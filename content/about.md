title: "About"

---

I am a self-taught programmer and (not self-taught) engineer. I graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). Most recently I was an early employee and propulsion engineer for [SpaceRyde](https://www.spaceryde.com/), a small satellite launch startup, but I've been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to dabble in a lot of fields. 

Some of my technical interests are space exploration, advanced manufacturing, synthetic biology, and energy policy.

# About this website 
This is a place for me to publish my various thoughts (perhaps a more apt description is "shout into the void"). I have a fairly broad range of topics I am interested in and I don't have any particularly strong criteria on what should be a post other than it being a discussion I feel is worth sharing&mdash;for better or for worse. In terms of technical depth, I'm aiming for somewhere in between a journal paper and a Vox long-form article, which I think is an underserved niche. 

The site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The design is based on the [Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) theme, although with [several modifications of my own](https://github.com/LiemDQ/hugo-theme-anubis).
