title: "About"

---

I work at [Prometheus Fuels](https://www.prometheusfuels.com/), developing an electrochemical process for producing cost-effective carbon-neutral liquid fuels from the air. I've been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to dabble in many fields. Previously, I was an early employee and propulsion engineer for [SpaceRyde](https://spaceryde.webflow.io/), a (sadly now defunct) rocket startup.


## What is this website? 
This is a place for me to publish my various thoughts (perhaps a more apt description is "shout into the void"). I have a fairly broad range of topics I am interested in and I don't have any particularly strong criteria on what should be a post other than it being something I feel is worth sharing (for better or for worse).

## Site design

The site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The design is a [fork](https://github.com/LiemDQ/hugo-theme-anubis) of the (now unmaintained) [Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) theme, with stylistic changes inspired by [Edward Tufte](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
