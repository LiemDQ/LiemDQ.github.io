title: "About"

---

I work at [Prometheus Fuels](https://www.prometheusfuels.com/), developing an electrochemical process for cost-effective carbon-neutral liquid fuels from the air. I've been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to dabble in many fields. Previously, I was an early employee and propulsion engineer for [SpaceRyde](https://spaceryde.webflow.io/), a (sadly now defunct) rocket startup.


# What is this website? 
This is a place for me to publish my various thoughts (perhaps a more apt description is "shout into the void"). I have a fairly broad range of topics I am interested in and I don't have any particularly strong criteria on what should be a post other than it being something I feel is worth sharing&mdash;for better or for worse. In terms of technical depth, I'm aiming for somewhere in between a journal paper and a Vox long-form article, which I think is an underserved niche. 

## Site design

The site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The design is a fork of the (now unmaintained) [Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) theme, which I've adapted with [several modifications of my own](https://github.com/LiemDQ/hugo-theme-anubis).
