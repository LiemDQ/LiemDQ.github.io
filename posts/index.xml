Kennedy stepped up to the podium to make a speech before the assembled throngs of people below. Or rather, his aides did. The ongoing Cuban missile crisis demanded his presence in Washington, so he instead gave the speech through a telephone call. The matter, however, was deemed of sufficient importance that Vice-President Lyndon Johnson was in attendance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the stage was a dense, tangled maze of stainless steel piping, tanks, and stairways—the fruits of labor of countless scientists, engineers, and government officials who had been working relentlessly for years. And thanks to their efforts, the project had been completed at breakneck speed. Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s speech was to commemorate the opening of the facility, and the geopolitical situation did not temper his enthusiasm or his grandiloquence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Today,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;was an important step towards securing one of man&amp;rsquo;s oldest dreams&amp;rdquo;. With effusive praise for the scientists and engineers involved, he went on to declare that he could not think of a cause that was more important &amp;ldquo;to people around the globe&amp;rdquo;, and that this was &amp;ldquo;a work that in many ways is more important than any other scientific enterprise in which this country is now engaged&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kennedy was not talking about space exploration, the Apollo program or the goal of landing a man on the moon, which he had announced a month earlier in an address to Congress. He was talking about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/nor-any-drop-to-drink">the opening of a desalination plant in Freeport, Texas&lt;/a>, the first of its kind ever built. Fed by belching coal boilers, it would be capable of producing one million gallons of freshwater per day, providing relief to the drought-ravaged town of Freeport, as well as a nearby chemical plant owned by the Dow Chemical Company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The practical implications were overshadowed by the symbolic ones. The 1960s were an era of unbridled optimism and the belief in the ability of science and technology to deal the finishing blow in mankind&amp;rsquo;s eternal war against poverty, disease, drought, and famine. Medical advances and improved sanitation increased the average American lifespan from &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1040079/life-expectancy-united-states-all-time/">53 years in 1920 to 70 years in 1960&lt;/a>. Nuclear power promised cheap, abundant electricity. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green Revolution&lt;/a> made crop yields explode, cementing America&amp;rsquo;s food security. It seemed that the final enemy left to overcome was drought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a sense, this plant represented the ultimate triumph of human ingenuity over the vicissitudes of the weather and climate. Finally, mankind would meet its basic needs in &amp;ldquo;areas in which Nature was not generous&amp;rdquo;. The deserts would bloom, and men and women in dry climates everywhere would be lifted out of poverty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The starry-eyed enthusiasm didn&amp;rsquo;t last. The high spirits of the age were met with crushing economic reality. The mercurial nature of weather goes both ways, and a few years later, the rains came back to South Texas. It cost the government $1.25 to produce one thousand gallons of water, which it sold to the town of Freeport for ¢30, the price of naturally sourced water. Once the funds dedicated to the project ran out, Congress had no inclination to keep producing a now-abundant commodity at a loss. The plant shut down in 1969. The 1970s energy crisis, which more than tripled the cost of oil, also severely curtailed any incentive to build these terribly energy intensive facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat of a stroke of irony that 70% of the world&amp;rsquo;s surface is covered in water, yet the IPCC estimates that 80% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population faces serious threats to water security. Like the Greek figure Tantalus, there&amp;rsquo;s a promise of plentiful water that frustratingly forever lies just-so-slightly out of reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most water used by humans comes from the &lt;a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle">hydrological cycle&lt;/a>. In the warm ocean regions, water evaporates and thanks to atmospheric circulation, moves around the globe. Eventually, it condenses into clouds and falls out of the sky as precipitation. Depending on where it lands, the water can accumulate in ice caps or glaciers, flow back into the oceans through rivers, or be stored in lakes or aquifiers. Although the water eventually makes its way back to the oceans, all these serve as sources of fresh water for humans, plants, and animals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/water_cycle.png" alt="Water cycle">
&lt;figcaption>The water cycle.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the availability of these resources is highly location-dependent. There&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that your land will be pocked by lakes, that rivers will run free, or that the aquifier will provide useful quantities of water. There are only two ways to increase the available water supply beyond the cycle can provide: water reuse and desalination. And if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have water to begin with, the first option is not particularly helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Climate change will make all these issues worse. Droughts will increase in severity and the distribution of rainfall, snowmelt and river flows will shift. Potentially billions of people will experience water shortages, and an overall more precarious water supply situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address these issues, we will need to turn to seawater desalination more and more. Historically, it&amp;rsquo;s been an incredibly energy-intensive process, resulting in high costs as well as increased environmental impact, which limits its potential usefulness. But could that be improved? How much better could it get, and would more R&amp;amp;D get us there?&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The largest, most challenging and complex part of a chemical plant is not, as is popularly thought, the reactors that combine chemicals to produce new ones, but rather it is usually the process of splitting a mixture of chemicals into distinct streams of a specified purity. This discipline is known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process">separation processes&lt;/a>, and it is the bread and butter of chemical engineering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, desalination is a relatively easy process. Humans have done it for millenia—Aristotle noted that &amp;ldquo;salt water, when it turns into vapour, becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses&amp;rdquo;. But it was never feasible on a large scale prior to the Industrial Revolution, due to the high energy requirements, and was subsequently of little interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea was revisited during the 1800s with the advent of , mostly in military contexts. Militaries were not as concerned about economic viability as they were with the logistical convenience of being able to produce fresh water for their troops &lt;em>in-situ&lt;/em>. Research into economic desalination accelerated after WWII, particularly in the United States. In the 1950s, the southern US underwent a severe drought—the worst in the nation&amp;rsquo;s history—and there was significant political pressure to find a solution. This is when some began to consider the possibility of large-scale, economic distillation of seawater as a source of water security and a bulwark against the fitful caprices of rain. Comgress passed the Saline Water Conversion Act in 1952, which led to the creation of the Office of Saline Water in 1955 and its eventual merging with the Office of Water Resources Research in 1974.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first desalination plants, like the one in Freeport, used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_flash_distillation">multi-stage flash distillation&lt;/a> (MSF) to distill the water. The idea is quite simple: boil the water and collect it, leaving the salt behind. A series of heat exchangers captures the heat from the condensing vapor to boil a subsequent stage of water, minimizing energy waste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/nomac_thermal_msf.jpg" alt="MSF distillation plant">
&lt;figcaption>MSF distillation plants can be identified by the rows of successive tanks placed in series, which are used to recycle heat from vaporization. Pictured here is the Shoaiba desalination plant in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are effective at producing drinkable water, but there&amp;rsquo;s a downside. They are &lt;em>terribly&lt;/em> energy intensive. No matter how you slice it, boiling water takes a lot of energy, and not all of it can be recuperated. A typical MSF plant achieves a Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) of &lt;a href="http://www.iags.org/n0813043.htm">23-27 kWh per m3 of water&lt;/a>. At an electricity price of 20 cents per kWh, that means it would cost $5.00 to produce 1000L of water. But in comparison, the &lt;a href="https://www.akwater.com/story_of_water/html/costs.htm">average price of water in the USA is only $0.40 per 1000L&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paying over 12 times the average price for your water is a tough sell. In many cases, it would be cheaper to simply ship the water in from elsewhere. So it&amp;rsquo;s unsurprising that MSF desalination never saw the widespread adoption that Kennedy and Johnson would have liked, and indeed, in the 1970s, funding for desalination dried out. Desalination was a niche technology of last resort, only used in locations that had access to abundant energy but for whatever reason could not source water any other way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ultimate success of the industry can be credited to &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-sci-tech/science-and-environment/in-appreciation-sidney-loeb-desalination-pioneer-dies-at-91">Sidney Loeb&lt;/a>, an American-Israeli chemical engineer, who invented the first practical reverse-osmosis membrane, a much more energy efficient technology, thereby setting the stage for widespread economic viability. By the 1980s, membrane technology had become the standard for new desalination plants around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-reverse-osmosis-works" >How reverse osmosis works
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#how-reverse-osmosis-works">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Reverse osmosis is achieved by pushing the water across a semipermeable membrane via a pressure gradient. In a typical setup, the water, after having been filtered for large debris like branches, rocks, algae, etc., is fed through a pump and through a series of concentric tubes.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_membrane.png">
&lt;figcaption>An cutaway of a reverse osmosis membrane. From &lt;a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-22682.pdf">PNNL Technical Report 22682&lt;/a>&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>On the face of it, this just seems to be like any other kind of filtering process. &lt;em>What&amp;rsquo;s the big deal?&lt;/em> I use a &amp;ldquo;semipermeable membrane&amp;rdquo; to separate the coffee grounds from my coffee every morning. Why does this have a fancy name attached to it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main difference between reverse osmosis and a filtering system is the spontaneity of the process. A fluid filled with undesirable particles will naturally flow through a sieve in the absence of a minimal driving force (often, the only force is gravity). Increasing the pressure will increase the flow rate through the filter, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a requirement. If I was fine with waiting forever, eventually &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of the coffee would trickle down through the filter, absent a small amount retained due to surface tension, resulting in a separation efficiency of nearly 100%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> spontaneous. If you place a concentrated salt solution next to a reverse osmosis membrane without applying a driving force, nothing will happen. The water will never migrate across the membrane on its own. To make this happen, you need to fight against the osmotic pressure generated by the difference in salt concentration across the membrane. This is where the majority of the energy requirements come from: pressurizing the water to force it across. The amount of pressure needed depends on the membrane permeability as well as the concentration of salt in the seawater.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;figcaption>A process flow diagram of a reverse osmosis unit. Pumps are used to provide the pressure needed to force the water across the membrane.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pressure requirements are where the bulk of the energy consumption for desalination come from. But how much of that is actually needed? Would it be possible to create some kind of magical filter that would let water pass through really easily, but keep the salt out, or to invent some new technique that would be able to sidestep the need for high pressure? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that allow us to have cheap and easy freshwater anywhere in the world, and thus eliminate the threat of thirst for humankind once and for all?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, the answer is no. &lt;em>There is a fundamental thermodynamic limit to how energy efficient desalination—and other separation processes—can be&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-energy-of-unmixing" >The energy of unmixing
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-energy-of-unmixing">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So how much energy is &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> needed to separate a mixture&amp;rsquo;s components from one another? What is, so to speak, the theoretical minimum? We&amp;rsquo;re going to actually mathematically derive it in this section, but if you are not interested in that,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s start by defining what we mean by &amp;ldquo;mixture&amp;rdquo;. We are referring to a fluid consisting of multiple components (e.g. water, salt, sugar, ethanol) but which has homogenous physical properties throughout the fluid. By contrast, a fluid with heterogeneous physical properties (e.g. water with sand and sticks in it) is called a suspension. There are some additional subtleties&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, but this definition is good enough for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, is it even a given that separating two fluids from each other &lt;em>requires&lt;/em> energy? The answer is an emphatic &lt;em>yes&lt;/em>. At a very high level, one can make a somewhat handwavy argument using entropy: two separate pure chemicals have lower entropy than a single vat with both chemicals mixed together. Since, from the second law of thermodynamics, entropy must always increase, then we could make the argument that separating the two requires work to be applied so that entropy increases elsewhere (most likely from the process used to generate useful work)&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we need to expend energy to separate fluids, because we are fighting entropy. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid argument, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly useful one—it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really provide any intuition about the relevant physics nor does it us tell anything about &lt;em>how much&lt;/em> energy is needed. Fortunately, it does give us an idea where to look: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_of_mixing">entropy of mixing&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, which, for a two-component mixture, is given by the following equation:
$$
\Delta S_{mix} = -nR[x\ln x + (1-x)\ln (1-x)]
$$
$x$ is the mole fraction of the first component, and since there are two components, $x_1 + x_2 = 1 \rightarrow x_2 = x_1-1$. $n$ and $R$ are the number of moles in the system and the ideal gas constant, respectively. As $0 \leq x \leq 1$, then $\ln x$ and $\ln(x-1)$ are both negative and thus $\Delta S_{mix}$ is always positive, as expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, let&amp;rsquo;s look at a high-level block diagram of a hypothetic reverse osmosis unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_block.png" alt="Block diagram of RO unit">
&lt;figcaption>RO unit with a 50% recovery ratio.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we want to extract fresh water from the process, we can&amp;rsquo;t extract &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of the water, or there would be nothing to transport the salt out of the system. Thus we have one stream—the seawater—going into the unit and two streams exiting it: a stream of desalinated water, and a stream of concentrated saltwater (called the brine). The ratio of the flow rate of the fresh water stream to the inlet stream is called the &lt;em>recovery ratio&lt;/em>.
$$
R_w = \frac{\text{freshwater flow rate}}{\text{feed flow rate}}
$$
The recovery ratio roughly captures a tradeoff between capital expenditures and operating expenditures. Desalination plants commonly use a recovery ratio of 50%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the entropy of mixing, we want to next get an expression for the thermodynamic favorability of the process. The desired outcome doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen because it would decrease the entropy of the system. This means that we need to add energy to make the process thermodynamically favorable. This quantity is given by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy">Gibbs free energy&lt;/a> of mixing.
$$
\Delta G_{mix} = \Delta H - T\Delta S_{mix} = nRT[x\ln x + (1-x)\ln (1-x)]
$$
Where $\Delta H$ is enthalpy and $T$ is temperature (in absolute units). Without adding energy to the system $(\Delta H = 0)$, the Gibbs free energy is always negative so mixing will spontaneously occur. But we&amp;rsquo;re interested in the Gibbs free energy of &lt;em>separation&lt;/em>, not mixing. This is calculated by taking the difference between the free energy of mixing of the two exit streams and the free energy of mixing of the initial feed:
$$
\Delta G_{sep} = \Delta G_{mix, brine} + \Delta G_{mix, fresh} - \Delta G_{mix, feed}
$$
We&amp;rsquo;re starting to get somewhere useful, but this is still too abstract. We want to substitute in values that we can measure in order to get an physical intuition about the system. From here, we can do two things: normalize $\Delta G$ to a per-mole basis and then multiply by the relative flowrates of each stream, and then convert the per-mole basis to a per-volume basis, giving us energy per volume of water, i.e. the Specific Energy Consumption. With some manipulations we can get the following equation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
SEC = 2RT \left[\frac{c_{feed}}{R_w}\ln\left(\frac{c_{brine}}{c_{feed}}\right) - c_{fresh}\ln\left(\frac{c_{brine}}{c_{fresh}}\right)\right]
$$
Where $c$ is the concentration of ions (in mol/m3) in the stream. Note that salt dissociates into &lt;em>two&lt;/em> ions, which is why the equation is multiplied by two. If we further assume that the freshwater stream has perfect rejection (completely removes salt), then $c_{fresh} = 0$ and so we get the simplified version:
$$
SEC = \frac{2RTc_{feed}}{R_w}\ln\left(\frac{c_{brine}}{c_{feed}}\right)
$$
At this point, this is looking like something we can work with, but we can make some further substitutions. The first is from the definition of the recovery ratio. Since
$$
\frac{c_{brine}}{c_{feed}} = \frac{1}{1- R_w}
$$
Secondly, while these values are all things we can directly measure, it would be useful to relate them into a single value that is relevant to the process at hand: osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that only solute concentration will affect it. The relationship between solute concentration and osmotic pressure for dilute solutions can be estimated using the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure#Theory_and_measurement">van&amp;rsquo;t Hoff equation&lt;/a>:
$$
\Pi = icRT
$$
Where $c$ is the solute concentration and $i$ is an index term that corrects for the actual concentration of particles produced when a solute is dissolved. Hmm, looks familiar! Thus the SEC needed to separate a water-salt mixture is:
$$
SEC = -\frac{\Pi}{R_w}\ln(1-R_w)
$$
For a typical seawater salt concentration of 35 g/L, (with a resulting osmotic pressure of 29.7 bar), and assuming a recovery ratio of 50%, we get a value of 1.1 kWh/m3 of water. This means that no matter the separation technique, it is thermodynamically impossible to desalinate water using less energy than this&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_sec.png" alt="Energy requirements vs. recovery ratios">
&lt;figcaption>Specific energy consumption of perfect seawater separation as a function of recovery ratio. Since this is a convex function, there should be some optimal recovery ratio given capital and operating expense models.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the other way around. Certain separation techniques will be more energy efficient than others, and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason that any specific separation technique would be able to reach the theoretical minimum. It turns out that reverse osmosis in particular &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c01194">is capable of doing so&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other, perhaps unintuitive conclusion is that osmosis is &lt;em>a natural consequence of the second law of thermodynamics&lt;/em>. Without it, you would theoretically be able to create a net reduction in entropy simply by using a reverse osmosis membrane as a sieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="additional-limitations" >Additional limitations
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#additional-limitations">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This analysis applies to a thermodynamically reversible process, but this can&amp;rsquo;t be done in practice. The problem is that as the water gets transferred across the membrane, the concentration of the brine increases, which leads to a corresponding increase in the osmotic pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, to achieve perfect efficiency we would need to continuously increase the pressure &lt;em>along the membrane&lt;/em> proportionately to the increase in salt concentration. This is, to say the least, an impractical arrangement. The best we could do, assuming no pressure losses, would be to maintain the pressure constant over the length of the membrane. This means that in order to achieve the recovery ratio we want, the pressure needs to be at least equal to the final osmotic pressure of the brine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_membrane_cross_section.jpg" alt="RO membrane cross-section">
&lt;figcaption>As the feed water flows through the membrane, it becomes more and more concentrated in salt as some of the water flows across the membrane. To maintain equilibrium, the pressure would have to continually increase down the membrane, which is impossible!&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we plot the equilibrium pressure vs. water recovery on a graph, and the area below the graph is &amp;ldquo;thermodynamic minimum&amp;rdquo; energy and the area above is the &amp;ldquo;wasted&amp;rdquo; energy.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This relationship is, in a sense, the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html">rocket equation&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; of desalination, because there&amp;rsquo;s very few ways to actually improve it. The equilibrium curve is a fundamental property of the fluid, and so there&amp;rsquo;s no technological solution that can change it. There&amp;rsquo;s only two things we can do: change the target recovery ratio, or, just like with rockets, add staging by changing the number of &amp;ldquo;steps&amp;rdquo; we take to reach the final recovery fraction.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means instead of having a single large reverse osmosis unit, we place multiple smaller units in series, with pumps in between each unit to boost the pressure to the new equilibrium pressure. However, this tends to significantly increase capital and maintenance costs, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t a lightly made design decision.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>All of this theoretical discussion is interesting, but meaningless unless we&amp;rsquo;re at energy consumption levels where the theory is actually relevant. And if we had remained stuck at 1970s-era membrane technology, this would be the case. But fortunately, modern membranes have come a very long way, with an almost 90% reduction in energy consumption since then.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_power_consumption.png">
&lt;figcaption>Progress in SEC for reverse osmosis membranes since 1970. This is based on laboratory results, but commercial-grade membranes have followed the same trend. Source: &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1200488">Elimelech and Phillip, 2011&lt;/a>.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>They can now sustainably achieve a thermodynamic efficiency of around 80%, which means they only require about 20% more energy than the thermodynamic limit. A single-stage RO process with 50% recovery requires ~1.6 kWh/m3 of energy in theory, and so the best single-stage RO systems available today consume about 2.0 kWh/m3 in practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does that number actually mean? Canada consumed about &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3810027101">4.86 billion cubic metres of potable water in 2019&lt;/a>. If all of that water came from desalination, it would represent an additional 9.7 TWh of electricity per year. Canada&amp;rsquo;s annual electricity production is &lt;a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-canada.html">about 632 TWh&lt;/a>, so desalination would roughly represent 1.5% of total consumption. By comparison, if MSF desalination was used instead, it would require over 120 TWh to supply all of Canada&amp;rsquo;s water!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the reverse osmosis step is but one of several needed to obtain drinkable water, but state-of-the-art facilities like in Israel are &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> efficient. The Sorek plant, which opened in 2013, consumes about &lt;a href="https://www.eib.org/attachments/registers/129182965.pdf">740 GWh annually&lt;/a> and has a &lt;a href="https://www.ide-tech.com/en/our-projects/sorek-desalination-plant/?data=item_1">capacity of 624,000 m3/day&lt;/a>, enough water for 1.5 million people. This corresponds to a total energy consumption of 3.3 kWh/m3. So on top of the ~2.0 kWh/m3 needed for reverse osmosis, they only need 1.3 kWh/m3 for pre-filtration, post-treatment, intake, discharge, pressure losses, and the works. It is an &lt;em>incredible&lt;/em> achievement that we are able to get this close.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These systems are &lt;em>much&lt;/em> more complex than the simple process flow diagram previously shown, with parallelized pipelines, circulation loops, heat exchangers, and energy recovery devices. A typical piping and instrumentation diagram for a reverse osmosis system will look like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very common way to improve the energy efficiency is to attempt to reuse as much of the pressure energy from the brine as possible, since it exits as high pressure but no longer has any need to be pressurized. &lt;a href="https://energyrecovery.com/water/px-pressure-exchanger/">Pressure exchangers&lt;/a> are nifty devices that can do this with very high efficiency—in a sense they fulfill a similar function as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbopump">gas generator turbopump&lt;/a> in a rocket engine&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;figcaption>This is so cool.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
And this is only a fraction of the plant's functionality! Depending on the quality of the membrane and permeate, sometimes an additional pass is needed, called Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis (BWRO). In addition, the plant requires systems for prefiltering the water and handling all the sludge that gets separated out, a post-treatment system that adds minerals, disinfects and adjusts the pH, and antiscaling systems that flush out minerals from the RO membranes to prevent fouling, and more!

&lt;a href="#can-we-improve-on-this">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The energy intensity of desalination is one of the primary reasons why it hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen more widespread adoption. Electricity costs account for &lt;a href="https://www.advisian.com/en/global-perspectives/the-cost-of-desalination">almost half of the operating costs&lt;/a> of a typical desalination facility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/opex.png" alt="OPEX of RO plant">
&lt;figcaption>Power is a significantly larger contributor to operating costs than any other factor. Reducing costs everywhere else will be a multifaceted, arduous effort. For example, reducing maintenance costs by 50% would only result in an overall 3.5% reduction in opex.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And unfortunately, that means there&amp;rsquo;s no silver bullet to make desalination cheaper. There are only three ways to improve the energy efficiency of desalination:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Use a membrane that is closer to thermodynamic limits&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reducing the recovery ratio&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introducing a pressure ramp during the reverse osmosis process.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For #1, the thermodynamic limit places a fundamental restriction on its energy efficiency. We&amp;rsquo;re not at a local maximum, we&amp;rsquo;re approaching the &lt;em>global&lt;/em> maximum. Even if you invented a groundbreaking, &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; membrane, it would be at best 20% more energy efficient than the state of the art today. But in practice diminishing returns are likely to apply here as well: individual percentage point improvements to efficiency are going to become harder and harder to chase, while R&amp;amp;D costs will soar. As &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ee/d0ee00341g">this sobering review&lt;/a> by Patel et al. notes, there is a &amp;ldquo;universal insignificance of novel materials in further enhancing the energy efficiency of desalination&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>#2 is a classical engineering trade study. But the tradeoff becomes increasingly steep at the extremes. At 100% recovery, you would need an infinitely high pressure to achieve the desired flow rate, and at 0% recovery, you would need an infinitely large feed stream to get any kind of freshwater whatsoever. Could R&amp;amp;D conceivably reduce the capital expenditure of building high-flow systems? Sure, but at this point the technological surface area that needs to be covered is massive. Could you improve pipes by adding a coating to reduce friction? Find ways to make the coating less expensive? Find ways to manufacture pumps for cheaper? And these will only chip away at the overall costs, since their impact is directly proportional to their percentage of the total cost of the system. These incremental improvements could happen incidentally, but are not worth seeking out specifically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>#3 actually has some potential for improvement. There&amp;rsquo;s a fair bit of unexplored territory—adding multiple stages is not the only way to accomplish #3. Another approach is called batch reverse osmosis. Instead of continually flowing the water through in a steady-state configuration, you perform the reverse osmosis in big, static vats, where you gradually increase the pressure over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/batch_pfd.png" alt="Batch RO PFD diagram">
&lt;figcaption>Simplified PFD of a batch RO process. The loop pressure is slowly increased over time to follow the gradually rising equilibrium pressure.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lets you, in principle, approach the thermodynamic efficiency, although there are other inefficiencies with batch processes that need to be overcome. And as you can imagine, throughput becomes a problem since you have to perform all the operations sequentially: filling the vat, pressurizing the vat, and emptying the vat. This means you spend only a fraction of your time actually producing freshwater.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, this &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/breakthrough-in-reverse-osmosis-may-lead-to-most-energy-efficient-seawater-desalination-ever.html">press release by Purdue University&lt;/a> describing a new reverse osmosis &amp;lsquo;breakthrough&amp;rsquo; is simply a system that increases the throughput of a batch process by using alternating chambers and a reciprocating piston to ensure water is always being pressed through a membrane. They were able to achieve a SEC of 1.88 kWh/m3, which is a modest improvement over traditional continuous processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/double_batch_ro.png">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In practice, this would probably end up shifting the recovery ratio &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo;, so that the plant could use smaller feed streams to produce the same quantity of potable water, resulting in small reductions in capital and operating costs. There&amp;rsquo;s still a long way to go, though. These systems haven&amp;rsquo;t proven that they can scale up well, or that they can operate with the same longevity as continuous systems. And at the end of the day, there&amp;rsquo;s still a limit that can&amp;rsquo;t be overcome, regardless of the approach used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mean" >What does this mean?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#what-does-this-mean">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Desalination has reached its endgame. As energy efficient as desalination has become, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to improve much beyond this point. And while the costs have dramatically improved, achieving low costs requires a serious amount of domain expertise and capital, and these requirements are unlikely to ever go away. The dreams of making deserts bloom remain that—literal pipe dreams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, about 1% of the world&amp;rsquo;s drinking water is provided through desalination. This is likely going to rise as water security issues become more pressing. And the amount of desalination plants being built is rising, thanks to the dropping costs. But capacity is growing steady, with no evidence of an &amp;ldquo;exponential&amp;rdquo; adoption curve—if anything, growth is slowing down, as the lowest-hanging fruits get picked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a common idea that droughts are acute, but short periods of no rainfall. While this can be the case, in reality they are often prolonged periods of &lt;em>reduced&lt;/em> rainfall that can last years. And while a plant can be built, commissioned, and run profitably for a few years over the duration of a long drought, these plants are typically planned and designed to operate over timescales of 30+ years. And just like what happened with Freeport, this makes the economic projections of these ventures fraught with uncertainty. Desalination is a long-term solution, and thus the political and economic incentives also need to be long-term ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/water_security.png" alt="Desalination map">
&lt;figcaption>Desalination plant locations contrasted with global water security risk. While there is some overlap, it&amp;#39;s clear to see that these plants are not necessarily being built where they will have the most impact.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, I used Canada as an example of the &amp;ldquo;reasonable&amp;rdquo; energy demands of modern desalination, but it should be pointed out that Canada is one of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption">most energy intensive countries per capita&lt;/a> as well as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most developed economies. Even at these very high efficiencies, poorer countries, particularly those in regions most susceptible to water insecurity, would likely still struggle to provide a sufficient amount of power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does this mean desalination R&amp;amp;D is a dead-end as a career field? That depends on your idea of a dead-end. We focused exclusively on energy efficiency, but there are a whole host of other considerations with RO systems that we barely even touched upon, with membrane longevity and fouling resistance being key among them. There are still &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51547620_The_Future_of_Seawater_Desalination_Energy_Technology_and_the_Environment">a lot of avenues to research&lt;/a>. And there&amp;rsquo;s always the holistic approach. As Patel et al. argues, we need to begin to focus more on &amp;ldquo;the importance of process engineering—in place of innovation of advanced materials—for the sustained optimization of desalination energy efficiency.&amp;rdquo; If the world is to truly lean on desalination—and it is good enough to do so—then we will need lots of experienced people who know how to design and build efficient desalination plants in a cost-effective manner. Someone capable of doing so will likely have many times more impact than someone who comes up with a 2% more energy efficient membrane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, just because desalination isn&amp;rsquo;t becoming more energy efficient doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it can&amp;rsquo;t become more economic, which is ultimately what we care about. One way of viewing it is that desalination technology transforms a &lt;em>water scarcity problem&lt;/em> into an &lt;em>energy scarcity&lt;/em> problem. And while in some respects the same limitations remain—access to capital, skilled labor and political will—in others it makes the solution less dependent on the local geographical situation, since access to the sea for non-landlocked nations is usually not a big deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the most effective way to make desalination more accessible is to go work in photovoltaics R&amp;amp;D and deployment. One way of making the process less expensive is to reduce the cost of the inputs—&lt;a href="https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/">solar is cheap and only getting cheaper&lt;/a>. And perhaps desalination could even have a role to play with offload excess renewable production from the grid. &lt;a href="https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/smart-water-magazine/towards-solar-powered-desalination-a-path-research-and-challenges">Desalination facilities coupled with solar power&lt;/a> could be a cost-effective way of using excess power output, and the product, water, doesn&amp;rsquo;t spoil and is easy to store and transport. In fact, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261921002725">proposals to do just that&lt;/a> at the US-Mexico border.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If I had to choose one discipline to represent the art of engineering, desalination would be near the top of my list. In many ways, it&amp;rsquo;s emblematic of the engineering method&amp;rsquo;s greatest strengths, but also its biggest limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it&amp;rsquo;s a strong testament to the power of first principles reasoning and a scientifically-minded analysis. Starting from the &lt;em>statistical mechanics definition of entropy&lt;/em>, something so abstract and high-level that we would assume that it would only be good for ivory-tower theoreticians, we were able to infer a whole bunch of the design considerations and limitations of desalination plants, and also understand the motivations behind current desalination research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, it demonstrates how engineering can be used to improve the human condition. Stable access to water is a fundamental building block of civilization. It is necessary for life itself, yes, but it also feeds crops and carries away diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. It is the difference between an uninhabitable land and a hotbed of human activity. Millions of people, especially in the Middle East, rely on desalination to ensure that they can drink, cook, clean, and bathe on a regular basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, it shows how continuous, compounding iterative improvement can lead to astonishing advances. In the history of desalination research, there are very few specific points that could be considered &amp;ldquo;breakthroughs&amp;rdquo;. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s been a dogged and persistent effort by many scientists and engineers to bring the cost to the point where desalination is now a viable, cost-effective solution to many water supply issues rather than a niche, uneconomic venture wholly reliant on government subsidies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But on the other side of the coin, the very scientific principles that have led to these tremendous improvements also show that we&amp;rsquo;re near the end of the road. Better designs and better technology will help—to a point. But desalination will never become the technological silver bullet some people hoped for. Finding natural sources of water will almost always be cheaper. Instead, it will remain a tool in the arsenal of policymakers and governments around the world—a very useful tool, to be sure, but one with specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history of desalination shows how strongly its success has been intertwined with politics and economics. In the 1950s and 60s, research was reliably championed by Senator-and-eventually-President Lyndon Johnson, who had grown up in the Texas Hill Country and had felt the punishing consequences of drought firsthand. But many plants in the 1970s and 1980s were shut down, unable to justify their costs. And in 1982, Ronald Reagan shuttered the Office of Water Resources Research, as part of his agenda to defund most (non-military) government science programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When confronted with a large, complex, and multifaceted problem without straightforward solutions, politicians, at least in North America, have this tendency to punt the issue under the belief that &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; will find a solution. Eventually, someone will invent a cost-effective technology that will solve the problem so well that applying it will be a no-brainer. There will be no tough calls about resource allocation, no exposure to potential gaffes or weaknesses exploitable by the opposition, no need to spend valuable political capital. This is the standard response to the pressing issues of our day—calls for &amp;ldquo;increased investment&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;enabling innovators&amp;rdquo; and other techno-optimist speak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that playbook won&amp;rsquo;t work here. There is no technological solution coming. The technology we have now is what we have to work with. It is up to us to decide whether we care about the problem or not and whether we are willing to expend a portion of our very limited resources on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The engineering method won&amp;rsquo;t solve this. And it never will.&lt;/p>

One of the things that came up during my research was something called the &amp;lsquo;Kantrowitz limit&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the Kantrowitz limit? I admittedly had never heard of it before, but it seemed like something very important that fortunately had technological solutions. Yet there was something unsatisfying about all the popular resources I could find about it. They all seemed to be very surface level, and when I started looking into it the rabbit hole ended up going a lot deeper than I expected, so I am writing this in the hopes that it might be useful to someone else one day.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Kantrowitz limit is a theoretical compressible gas dynamics restriction that places a limit on the flow velocity. It was first derived in 1945 by Arthur Kantrowitz, a physicist and aerospace engineer, from whom it received its namesake, but remained relatively obscure—&lt;a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/modern-compressible-flow-historical-perspective-anderson/M9781260471441.html">&lt;em>Modern Compressible Flow&lt;/em> by John D. Anderson&lt;/a>, the quintessential textbook for gas dynamics, for example, has no mention of it—until 2013, when it was reintroduced into the mainstream engineering lexicon when Elon Musk proposed his Hyperloop concept for futuristic, high-speed travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Musk is a little vague about the Kantrowitz limit in his &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_images/hyperloop-alpha.pdf">Hyperloop white paper&lt;/a>, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really explain any of the technical details, except that it&amp;rsquo;s an important consideration when designing the Hyperlood pods. As he explains:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Whenever you have a capsule or pod (I am using the words interchangeably) moving at high speed through a tube containing air, there is a minimum tube to pod area ratio below which you will choke the flow. What this means is that if the walls of the tube and the capsule are too close together, the capsule will behave like a syringe and eventually be forced to push the entire column of air in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While this is possibly useful to laymen, it is a phenomenological explanation: it describes &lt;em>what&lt;/em> is happening, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on &lt;em>why&lt;/em>. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantrowitz_limit">Wikipedia article&lt;/a> has a fairly succinct explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If a near supersonic flow experiences an area contraction, the velocity of the flow will increase until it reaches the local speed of sound, and the flow will be choked. This is the principle behind the Kantrowitz limit: it is the maximum amount of contraction a flow can experience before the flow chokes, and the flow speed can no longer be increased above this limit, independent of changes in upstream or downstream pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Seems simple enough. The Kantrowitz limit is related to the gas dynamics at near-sonic flow velocities. For vehicles moving at near-supersonic speeds through a tunnel (i.e. Hyperloop pods), the Kantrowitz limit places a design constraint on the ratio of the diameter of the pod to the diameter of the tube.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>All of this is sensible and seems well and good&amp;hellip; except that this is a &lt;em>really, really basic concept that is known by anyone who has studied gas dynamics or aerodynamics at all&lt;/em>. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to be an elitist here: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choked_flow">choked flow&lt;/a> is probably taught by the second or third week of any undergraduate level gas dynamics course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So clearly, there should be more to it than this if someone got their name attached to it! Maybe the Wikipedia explanation was incomplete? What do other online sources on it say? There&amp;rsquo;s a surprising dearth of information—most of the articles I found only give a high level explanation of the Hyperloop. Those that &lt;em>do&lt;/em> dive into the relevant physics, despite otherwise widely ranging in credibility, all seem to just repeat what was said in the Hyperloop whitepaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://mappingignorance.org/2018/02/07/the-limits-of-hyperloop/">This article&lt;/a> by Mapping Ignorance repeats the &amp;ldquo;syringe effect&amp;rdquo;, and also cites an equation that seems to have been taken from the Wikipedia article&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/13/here-is-how-hyperloop-will-work-theoretically.html">CNBC&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mention the concept and just explains that compressor fan will &amp;ldquo;transfer high air pressure from [the pod&amp;rsquo;s] front to the rear and sides&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brilliant.org has a section on the &lt;a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/hyperloop/#physics-of-the-hyperloop">Physics of Hyperloop&lt;/a> where they also repeat the same claims about the Kantrowitz limit and the syringe effect. They directly quote the white paper on this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-key-innovation-that-makes-the-hyperloop-work-1113028439">An article&lt;/a> by Jalopnik specifically about the Kantrowitz limit just uncritically rephrases what Musk wrote, but it does cite &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130217232130/http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-AVT-185///EN-AVT-185-09.pdf">a paper&lt;/a> on the topic! But this paper assumes that you already know what the limit is, so some more digging is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also found &lt;a href="https://www.hyperloopdesign.net/airflow">this&lt;/a> from a site called HyperloopDesign.net which claims that there is no Kantrowitz limit for Hyperloop pods. However, their explanation of the relevant physics seems very dubious&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to consider their argument further.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

In short, the Kantrowitz limit has to do with the stability of normal shocks in variable-area ducts when decelerating gases from supersonic to subsonic velocities.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s do a brief aside and discuss the concept of choked flow, since it is rather critical to understanding the issue at hand. You can skip this section if you are already familiar with the relevant physics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a gas flowing through a variable-area duct&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. As the area of the duct shrinks, the gas must either speed up or compress (become denser) to maintain the same mass flow rate. The maximum speed that the gas can reach through a reduction in area is the speed of sound. Once this speed is reached, any further reduction in area cannot increase the speed further (and in fact the gas will always reach Mach 1 at the vena contracta, or point with the smallest cross-sectional area, as long as this area is below the crticial area).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/subsonic_choke_no_accel.png" alt="Example of choked flow">
&lt;figcaption>Flow through a converging duct, right at the point where the flow chokes (throat velocity has reached Mach 1).&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, any further reduction of the pressure downstream of the duct will not influence the flow rate; it is considered choked. However, increasing the pressure upstream &lt;em>will&lt;/em> increase the mass flow rate by increasing the density of the gas, but the volumetric flow rate will remain roughly the same. So there is a &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo; amount of shrinkage the duct area can undergo before the flow reaches Mach 1. This, of course, depends on how much the gas decides to speed up vs. compress when the area is reduced, and the &amp;ldquo;speed-up-to-densification&amp;rdquo; ratio depends on the assumptions you make of the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most commonly, we assume that the gas is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_gas">calorically perfect&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and that the compression process is isentropic. In this case, the relationship between the choking contraction ratio and the airspeed is known as the &lt;em>area-Mach number relation&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{1}{\text{Contraction ratio}} = \frac{A^*}{A} = M\left[\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)\right]^{-\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where $M$ is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number">Mach number&lt;/a> at some point in the duct (usually the entrance), $A$ is the area at the point in the duct where $M$ was taken, $A^*$ is the cross-sectional area at the minimum area of the duct (known as the &lt;em>throat&lt;/em>), and $\gamma$ is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity_ratio">heat capacity ratio&lt;/a>, which varies depending on the gas but for air is roughly equal to 1.4. The interesting thing about this equation is how the contraction ratio only depends on the Mach number; there are no variables for temperature, pressure, density, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/compression_ratio_to_mach_annot.png" alt="Area-Mach number relation">
&lt;figcaption>The area-Mach number relation creates a &amp;#39;U&amp;#39; shaped curve. Inside the U, the flow will be choked, and outside, the flow will be unchoked.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something worth noting is that there are actually two solutions of $M$ for a given contraction ratio: one for $M&amp;lt;1.0$ and one for $M&amp;gt;1.0$. This means for any given ratio, there is a subsonic speed below which the flow will not choke and a supersonic speed above which the flow will not choke, surprisingly enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/subsonic-acceleration.png" alt="Accelerating subsonic flow">
&lt;figcaption>Subsonic flow is accelerated in a converging nozzle and chokes at the throat. If the duct diverges after, the flow can accelerate to supersonic speeds.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
This is also the principle behind rocket engine nozzles: a convergent-divergent nozzle will accelerate a gas from subsonic to supersonic velocities as long as the pressure drop is sufficiently high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-with-supersonic-deceleration" >The problem with supersonic deceleration
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-problem-with-supersonic-deceleration">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Since this process is isentropic and therefore reversible, one would imagine that the opposite scenario should also be possible: a converging-diverging inlet that decelerates supersonic gas to subsonic velocities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/supersonic-deceleration.png" alt="Decelerating supersonic flow">
&lt;figcaption>Smooth deceleration of a supersonic stream. In practice, this is not achievable.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, however, this kind of arrangement is not possible to achieve and maintain. There are two problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is that generally, before reaching a supersonic velocity, the system has to first accelerate through a subsonic regime. And a subsonic flow will &lt;em>also&lt;/em> choke the inlet, but at a much lower mass flow rate. As the system speeds up in the subsonic regime, the gas will either get diverted away from the inlet. The ratio of air diverted away to air entering the inlet is called the &lt;em>capture ratio&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/subsonic-choked.png" alt="Choked sonic deceleration">
&lt;figcaption>Choked inlet at subsonic speeds. Some of the flow that would otherwise have entered the inlet is deflected away due to the pressure buildup.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the airspeed increases past the speed of sound, the gas can no longer turn away in time (since it cannot receive information faster than the speed of sound). A bow shock will form in front of the inlet, and the subsonic gas on the other side &lt;em>can&lt;/em> turn away from the inlet, maintaining mass continuity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/sonic-choked-deceleration.png" alt="Choked supersonic deceleration">
&lt;figcaption>Once the system settles at its (supersonic) cruising speed, a bow shock will form in front of the inlet. This leads to massive pressure losses, while the flow inside the duct is subsonic.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second problem is that even if a smooth supersonic deceleration is achieved, it is inherently unstable. Since the outgoing flow is subsonic, information about disturbances downstream (such as pressure fluctuations) would be able to propagate through it, lowering the mass flow rate, if only temporarily. However, since the entering gas is supersonic, information cannot propagate upstream through it, and its mass flow rate will remain unchanged. As Kantrowitz explains, &amp;ldquo;it therefore appears that isentropic deceleration through the speed of sound in channels is unstable and unattainable in practice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/unstable-shock.png" alt="Unstable shock">
&lt;figcaption>As the shock moves backwards, it becomes stronger as the flow at the new location is traveling faster, which leads to an even greater pressure drop, causing a feedback loop until the shock is ejected from the inlet.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="implications-of-shock-waves" >Implications of shock waves
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#implications-of-shock-waves">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Shocks are highly irreversible phenomena and will lead to significant amounts of energy dissipation. The total losses across the shock wave are captured by the drop in stagnation pressure. The stagnation pressure drop across a shock wave is given by the following equation:
$$
\frac{p_{t2}}{p_{t1}} = \left(\frac{\frac{\gamma+1}{2}M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} \left(\frac{1}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}M_1^2 - \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
$$
Where $p_t$ is the total, or stagnation pressure, and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote before and after the shock, respectively. The stagnation pressure, is, in turn, directly proportional to the mass flow rate through the duct, as given by the following equation:
$$
\dot m = \frac{p_t A}{\sqrt{T_t}}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{R}}\left(\frac{\gamma+1}{2}\right)^{-\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}
$$
For a given duct area $A$, the mass flow rate depends on the total pressure and the total temperature. Because a shock is adiabatic, the stagnation temperature does not change across a shock, so $\dot m \propto p_t$ only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/shock_pressure_recovery.png" alt="Pressure recovery">
&lt;figcaption>Pressure recovery of air across a normal shock, depending on supersonic Mach number&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, a shock wave will result in total pressure losses. These losses will reduce the mass flow rate through the inlet by the proportional drop in the pressure. A smaller mass flow rate means a smaller throat area is needed to choke the flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So the Kantrowitz limit basically is just the area-Mach number relation multiplied by the stagnation pressure ratio across a normal shock.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Writing out the equation, the Kantrowitz limit is the area ratio denoted by:
$$
\overbrace{\frac{A_4}{A_0}}^{\text{area ratio}} =
\overbrace{M\left[\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)\right]^{-\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}
}^{\text{area-Mach number relation}}
\underbrace{
\left(\frac{\frac{\gamma+1}{2}M^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} \left(\frac{1}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}M^2 - \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
}_{\text{stagnation pressure ratio across normal shock}}
$$
Simplifying and rearranging gives us the same form as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantrowitz_limit#Derivation_of_Kantrowitz_limit">Wikipedia article&lt;/a>:
$$
\frac{A_4}{A_0} = M_0 \left(\frac{\gamma+1}{2+(\gamma -1)M_0^2}\right)^{-\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}
\left[\frac{(\gamma+1)M_0^2}{(\gamma-1)M^2_0+2}\right]^\frac{-\gamma}{\gamma-1}
\left[\frac{\gamma+1}{2\gamma M^2_0-(\gamma-1)}\right]^\frac{-1}{\gamma-1}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotting it out compared the basic isentropic compression case, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the shock will greatly limit the design contraction ratio.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>Comparison of the choking contraction ratio with the Kantrowitz limit and with isentropic flow. The Kantrowitz effect means that the flow chokes much sooner than it otherwise would.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kantrowitz limit is thus relevant when a supersonic flow needs to be decelerated to subsonic flow, such as is the case in air intake ducts on supersonic planes. It appears repeatedly in the literature mostly in papers dealing with the design of supersonic intake ducts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And perhaps instead of &amp;ldquo;limit&amp;rdquo;, a more appropriate term would be &amp;ldquo;effect&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a limit at all. It&amp;rsquo;s an aerodynamics phenomenon that results in suboptimal mass flow/pressure recovery, but it&amp;rsquo;s not an outright cap on the performance of a system, like the term &amp;ldquo;limit&amp;rdquo; would imply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my great surprise, it does seem like everyone has gotten this wrong—&lt;em>no one&lt;/em> I found correctly explained this, and usually just parroted the &amp;ldquo;syringe&amp;rdquo; explanation from the Musk paper, despite the original paper being readily available online (and rather short: the meat and bones of it is only about 5 pages).&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Kantrowitz &amp;ldquo;effect&amp;rdquo; is undesirable as the pressure losses across the shock lower the mass flow rate through the duct. The total pressure ratio is also known as the &lt;em>pressure recovery&lt;/em>, with a perfect pressure recovery being a value of 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as it isn&amp;rsquo;t a hard limit, there are a few workarounds that can be employed to mitigate its effect. The general goal is to make the shock weaker, which will improve the pressure recovery. The most common way to do this is to move the shock wave into the inlet, &lt;em>behind&lt;/em> the throat. In this position, it is stable, and is much weaker than if it were outside and in front of the inlet. This is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;starting&amp;rdquo; the inlet.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The simplest solution is to temporarily overspeed the system above the design Mach number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the shock moves through the converging duct, a positive feedback loop will occur: its upstream Mach number will decrease, which means that the shock will &lt;em>weaken&lt;/em>. This results in the throat experiencing an increased mass flow rate, which will reduce the shock backpressure which draws the shock further into the duct. Thus the shock will continue moving until it has passed through the throat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/stable-shock.png" alt="Stable shock">
&lt;figcaption>In this position, the shock is stable. An increase in backpressure will push the shock back, but as it approaches the throat, it will weaken, improving the pressure recovery and causing a negative feedback loop that prevents it from being dislodged.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the opposite situation is also true. As previously mentioned, if the shock is placed at exactly the throat, and there is a temporary backpressure fluctuation, then that could be enough to knock the shock wave out of the inlet, leading to massive energy losses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/metastable-shock.png" alt="Metastable shock">
&lt;figcaption>The shock is at its weakest in the throat (technically, at M = 1.0, there is no shock). But the slightest disturbance or fluctuation in backpressure can have it knocked off and spat out of the inlet, causing a very sudden and disruptive drop in pressure.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is only a viable option for systems operating at relatively low Mach numbers. Beyond a design value of ~Mach 1.6 the amount of overspeeding needed becomes impractical from an engineering standpoint, and above Mach 1.9 it becomes flat out impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/overspeed.png" alt="Overspeed graph">
&lt;figcaption>The overspeed required to start inlets designed for specific Mach numbers dramatically grows above design Mach numbers of 1.6. The dashed line is y = x, for reference purposes.&lt;/figcaption>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Kantrowitz and Donaldson propose a simple solution: increasing the throat size so that it chokes at a &lt;em>subsonic&lt;/em> mass flow rate equal to the expected mass flow rate during supersonic operation at the design Mach number. This inlet design is also known as a Kantrowitz-Donaldson inlet, and it is &lt;em>self-starting&lt;/em>, because it will naturally settle at the desirable equilibrium point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/kantrowitz-donaldson.png" alt="Kantrowitz-Donaldson inlet">
&lt;figcaption>A Kantrowitz-Donaldson inlet has a wider throat which will automatically swallow the shock as soon as supersonic speeds are reached.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The downside is that the pressure recovery is lower than that of a normally-sized inlet since the inlet isn&amp;rsquo;t designed for the desired mass flow rate. The larger throat means the gas will decelerate less before reaching the shock, resulting in more pressure losses. So the tradeoff is whether you want a self-starting inlet that works at ~85% performance or one that needs to be manually started but works at ~95% performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In a similar vein, another solution is to adjust the size of the throat in real time to move the shock past the throat before closing it back up. This approach results in high pressure recovery (and therefore high performance), at the cost of complexity and additional weight.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The last solution is to use a geometry that will force the airflow to turn, producing a series of oblique shocks instead. These will lead to lower pressure losses than a single normal shock. These changes in angle are called &lt;em>ramps&lt;/em>. This can be done through systems like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake_ramp">intake ramps&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlet_cone">inlet cones&lt;/a>, which are a common sight on supersonic aircraft. Inlets that have these shocks occur outside of the inlet are called &lt;em>external compression&lt;/em> inlets, while those with shocks that occur inside the intake are called &lt;em>internal compression&lt;/em> inlets.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A lot of these considerations pertain to the design of aircraft, but let&amp;rsquo;s return to the original subject matter. The Kantrowitz limit doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be relevant to Hyperloop systems at all. It necessarily only applies to &lt;em>supersonic&lt;/em> systems. The vast majority of concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve seen still have pods traveling at subsonic velocities, which means you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the formation of a shock wave in front of the vehicle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the flow &lt;em>won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> choke, but the massive loss in stagnation pressure due to the shock is the reason why the choked mass flow rate will be significantly lower than what would otherwise be possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-will-actually-happen" >What will actually happen?

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve described the Kantrowitz effect in a scenario with free-flowing air, such as on aircraft: if the air cannot enter the duct, it simply flows around it. With Hyperloop, the situation is a bit different, since it&amp;rsquo;s in a closed tunnel, and there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere for the air to go except behind the the pod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the classical theory of gas dynamics, I would expect the following to happen as the Hyperloop capsule zips down the tube and reaches the choking velocity for its contraction ratio:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The flow reaches Mach 1 at the narrowest point between the capsule and the tunnel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Static pressure would build up in front of the capsule until the pressure is sufficient for the mass flow rates to equalize.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on the pod geometry, the flow may briefly accelerate past Mach 1 before hitting a shock wave as it encounters the backpressure from the air behind the capsule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The drag will increase due to the increased pressure in front as well as the wave drag from the shock wave.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>So Hyperloop pods will likely experience an increase in drag as they approach the sonic condition in the bypass duct. But the key question is: how much extra drag?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where Musk&amp;rsquo;s analogy of a syringe effect is, in my opinion, very misleading. The reason why the resistance of squeezing a plugged syringe rises so rapidly is because you are compressing the air to several multiples of its original pressure (presumably atmospheric). But in a tube that&amp;rsquo;s presumably hundreds or thousands of miles long, this effect would be a lot less dramatic. Yes, the pressure in front of the pod increases, but this would have the effect of increasing the mass flow through the bypass (recall the mass flow equation), so the system would eventually reach a steady-state equilibrium, so the force wouldn&amp;rsquo;t increase in an unbounded manner. But where does this steady state lie?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this question is very complex and requires the use of simulations to get meaningful answers. My gut feeling, based on drag profiles of transonic aircraft&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, is that the increase in drag would significant, but it would be on the order of 3-4x more as opposed a complete showstopper like 100x&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Since the drag of a a Hyperloop pod in near-vacuum conditions is already very low, it&amp;rsquo;s questionable whether adding a compressor or other onboard system to mitigate the effect is worth it at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, this depends on how big the pod is relative to the tunnel. But I suspect that other practical considerations, such as engineering tolerances and supporting equipment, will place an upper limit on the pod size before the drag from densified air in front becomes the main consideration.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their conclusion is that the drag coefficient does begin to increase significantly after choked flow is reached, but by a factor of ~3 for the speed range that they studied. They also concluded that adding a compressor would consume more energy than beefing up the propulsion system to deal with the increased drag. The difference is 231 kW to power the compressor vs. 31 kW to overcome drag—nearly an order of magnitude difference!&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s true that supersonic pods have explicitly &lt;em>not&lt;/em> been left off the table, even if there are no immediate plans for them. And at supersonic speeds, the &lt;em>actual&lt;/em> Kantrowitz effect would indeed apply. A shock would form in front of the vehicle, but unlike in typical scenarios where it would take place, there is nowhere for the air to go, so once again you would see a pressure buildup between the shock and the pod. Depending on the shape of the vehicle and its relative position in the tunnel the shock could take on different shapes as well. But it&amp;rsquo;s still somewhat questionable whether the use of a compressor is worth it, or whether there are other solutions, like the ones previously mentioned, that are simpler and more performant.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Not much. This could be interpreted as a win for Hyperloop systems, as the analysis, &lt;em>prima facie&lt;/em>, suggests that the aerodynamics are not a big problem. But I think the aerodynamics of the pod are a relatively unimportant part of the challenges with Hyperloop, although this facet has received a disproportionate amount of attention from the media (likely due to Musk&amp;rsquo;s unconventional solution of using a compressor, unlike the other aspects of the concept which have been proposed for a long time already).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But make no mistake, there are many other hurdles—technical, practical, economical and political—that need to be cleared to make Hyperloop a reality. Other people have already covered this to death, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into more detail here.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Everything we&amp;rsquo;ve seen would suggest that what Musk calls the Kantrowitz limit is really just the area-Mach number relation, and to my knowledge there isn&amp;rsquo;t a special name for it. Kantrowitz certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t think he came up with it, since he just mentions it offhandedly in the appendix of his paper, where he simply calls it the &amp;ldquo;isentropic area-contraction ratio&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why did Musk call it the Kantrowitz limit? To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure&amp;hellip; One could try to argue that the formation of the shock wave behind the choke point is reminiscent of the stable configuration described by Kantrowitz and Donaldson, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear from reading the paper that this isn&amp;rsquo;t really what they were concerned about. And naively applying the Kantrowitz limit equation to subsonic systems will get you into trouble—as this graph shows, it results in an underestimation of the true bypass ratio needed&amp;hellip; but these values are physically meaningless, since you can&amp;rsquo;t have a shock at subsonic velocities!&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But with that said, if there is a distinction to make here, it&amp;rsquo;s a mostly pedantic one. From quickly skimming a few of these papers, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they made this mistake. It seems to be a purely nomenclature thing. Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph from the MIT paper on the blockage ratio vs. free-stream Mach number, reproduced side-by-side with just the area-Mach number equations. Their results are correct—they just called it something it ain&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it seems that before 2013, the Kantrowitz limit was a niche phenomenon that applied to supersonic inlet duct design and was used almost exclusively in that context. After Musk published his white paper, everyone has since erroneously ascribed it to the phenomenon of choked flow and it has since been taken up and popularized &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DnmPcJ6OiBg?t=76">by&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HYrO03vqm4Q?t=448">everyone&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/I8sOxSa3j3g?t=56">else&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.

&lt;li>In a supersonic stream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unstarted&lt;/li>

And as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the issues described by the limit likely aren&amp;rsquo;t issues at all. I am not up-to-date with the latest developments in Hyperloop technology, but other people seem to be reaching the same conclusions: Virgin Hyperloop pods, for example, don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing very much to mitigate the drag from choked flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the very least, it seems that the Wikipedia pages on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantrowitz_limit">Kantrowitz limit&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop">Hyperloop&lt;/a>, at the time of writing, have some glaring inaccuracies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this, of course, needs to come with several caveats. I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent that much time looking into current-gen Hyperloop technologies, and I may have missed other people&amp;rsquo;s solutions to the pod aerodynamics. I&amp;rsquo;m also not an expert on compressible gas dynamics, so there&amp;rsquo;s always the possibility that I am mistaken somewhere. If someone has more information than me about this, please &lt;a href="mailto:liem.daq@gmail.com">get in touch&lt;/a>—I&amp;rsquo;d love to know!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I actually have no idea where this equation comes from. The paper that Wikipedia cites doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it, and from what I can tell it doesn&amp;rsquo;t match up with any of the classical equations I am familiar with. My suspicion is that it was incorrectly transcribed from a derivation of the Kantrowitz limit, since it lines up qualitatively. Hopefully it isn&amp;rsquo;t used for anything serious&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to even make of their claims. The Kantrowitz limit equation &lt;em>is specifically&lt;/em> for compressible fluids. Why would they think that we&amp;rsquo;ve overlooked the fact that gases become compressible at transonic velocities? And what they do mean by supersonic flow &amp;ldquo;compressing&amp;rdquo; the gas along the tunnel? Supersonic flows cannot, by definition, compress anything except through shock waves. That seems like something that would be important to mention. Where did they get all these numbers for the compression ratios?! And this is just the beginning of a long list of issues with this page.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:3">
&lt;p>The theory of aerodynamics and compressible gas dynamics is surprisingly young. The theory of supersonic shock waves was only developed in 1908, and theoretical solutions to fundamental problems such as flow fields over supersonic blunt bodies were still actively being researched until the mid 1960s. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Prandtl">Ludwig Prandtl&lt;/a>, considered to be the father of aerodynamics, died in 1953 and was still actively performing research.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:4">
&lt;p>The flow is usually understood to be due to a difference in pressure, but to be pedantic, it is really a difference in &lt;em>free energy&lt;/em>. Pressure is just potential kinetic energy.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:5">
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold for Mach numbers &amp;gt; 5.0, but in many cases is actually a fairly reasonable assumption for speeds below that and will generally get you within +/- 10% of the actual answer.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:6">
&lt;p>This is not really an apples-to-apples comparison, since aircraft, as previously mentioned, have free-flowing air around them. Transonic aircraft will experience &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mach_number">localized shock wave formation&lt;/a> which will result in significantly increased drag, which I ballpark to be within the same order of magnitude as in a Hyperloop pod traveling at its choking velocity.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:7">
&lt;p>There should also be a point where the drag will begin to &lt;em>decrease&lt;/em>, as more of the flow becomes supersonic and the boundary layer experiences less disruption. So it&amp;rsquo;s not like the drag will continue to monotonically increase, either.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:8">
&lt;p>To be clear, I am only commenting on the phenomenon as opposed to implying any kind of moral culpability on the part of Youtubers. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to expect them to do this much digging to get the proper background on a very niche aerodynamics effect.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
