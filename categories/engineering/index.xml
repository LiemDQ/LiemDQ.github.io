Kennedy stepped up to the podium to make a speech before the assembled throngs of people below. Or rather, his aides did. The ongoing Cuban missile crisis demanded his presence in Washington, so he instead gave the speech through a telephone call. The event, however, was deemed of sufficient importance that Vice-President Lyndon Johnson was in attendance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the stage was a dense, tangled maze of stainless steel piping, tanks, and stairways—the fruits of labor of countless scientists, engineers, and government officials who had been toiling relentlessly for years. And thanks to their efforts, the project had been completed at breakneck speed. Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s speech was to commemorate the opening of the facility, and the geopolitical situation did not temper his enthusiasm or his grandiloquence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Today,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;was an important step towards securing one of man&amp;rsquo;s oldest dreams.&amp;rdquo; He went on to declare that he could not think of a cause that was more important &amp;ldquo;to people around the globe&amp;rdquo;, and that this was &amp;ldquo;a work that in many ways is more important than any other scientific enterprise in which this country is now engaged.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this effusive praise, Kennedy was not talking about space exploration, the Apollo program or the goal of landing a man on the moon, &lt;a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/historic-speeches/address-to-joint-session-of-congress-may-25-1961">which he had announced a month earlier in an address to Congress&lt;/a>. He was talking about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/nor-any-drop-to-drink">the opening of a desalination plant in Freeport, Texas&lt;/a>—the first of its kind. Fed by belching coal boilers, it was capable of producing one million gallons of freshwater per day, providing relief to the drought-ravaged town of Freeport, as well as a nearby chemical plant owned by the Dow Chemical Company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The practical implications were overshadowed by the symbolic ones. The 1950s were an era of unbridled optimism and the belief in the ability of science and technology to deal the finishing blow in mankind&amp;rsquo;s eternal war against poverty, disease, famine and drought. Medical advances and improved sanitation increased the average American lifespan from &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1040079/life-expectancy-united-states-all-time/">53 years in 1920 to 70 years in 1960&lt;/a>. Nuclear power promised clean, abundant electricity, with prices eventually being “&lt;a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/history-101/too-cheap-to-meter.html">too cheap to meter&lt;/a>”. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green Revolution&lt;/a> made crop yields explode, cementing America&amp;rsquo;s food security. Now, it seemed that the final enemy left to overcome was drought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a sense, this plant represented the ultimate triumph of human ingenuity over the vicissitudes of the weather and climate. Finally, mankind would meet its basic needs in &amp;ldquo;areas in which Nature was not generous.&amp;rdquo; The deserts would literally bloom, and men and women in dry climates everywhere would be lifted into prosperity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The starry-eyed enthusiasm didn&amp;rsquo;t last. The high spirits of the age were met with crushing economic—and political—reality. The mercurial nature of weather goes both ways, and a few years later, the rains came back to South Texas. It cost the government \$1.25— \$14.87 in 2024 dollars—to produce one thousand gallons of water, which it sold to the town of Freeport for $0.30, the going price of naturally-sourced water. Once the funds dedicated to the project ran out, Congress had no inclination to keep producing a now-abundant commodity at a loss. The plant shut down in 1969. The 1970s energy crisis, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart">nearly tripled the cost of oil&lt;/a>, subsequently curtailed any incentive to build these fuel-hungry facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One of Earth’s greatest ironies is that although 70% of the world&amp;rsquo;s surface is covered in water, the IPCC estimates that &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter04.pdf#page=11">half of the world&amp;rsquo;s population faces serious water scarcity risks&lt;/a>. Like the Greek mythological figure Tantalus, there&amp;rsquo;s a promise of plentiful water that frustratingly forever lies just-so-slightly out of reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most water used by humans comes from the &lt;a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle">hydrological cycle&lt;/a>. In the warm ocean regions, water evaporates and thanks to atmospheric circulation, moves around the globe. Eventually, it condenses into clouds and falls out of the sky as precipitation. Depending on where it lands, the water can accumulate in ice caps or glaciers, flow back into the oceans through rivers, or be stored in lakes or aquifers. Although the water eventually makes its way back to the oceans, all these serve as sources of fresh water for humans, plants, and animals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the availability of these resources varies greatly with geographic region. There&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that your land will be pocked by lakes, that rivers will run free, or that the aquifer will provide useful quantities of water. If—or when—the need arises, there are only two ways to increase the available water supply: water reuse and desalination. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t have water to begin with, the first option is not very helpful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s why access to water has historically been the key determinant of the evolution of human settlements. Today, &lt;a href="https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/Populations-in-Coastal-Zones?section=Discover&amp;amp;selectedCollection=&amp;amp;zoom=3&amp;amp;lat=0&amp;amp;lng=0&amp;amp;pitch=0&amp;amp;bearing=0&amp;amp;basemap=dark&amp;amp;labels=light&amp;amp;layers=%255B%257B%2522dataset%2522%253A%2522995ec4fe-b3cc-4cf4-bd48-b89d4e3ea072%2522%252C%2522opacity%2522%253A1%252C%2522layer%2522%253A%25222e533124-3258-4ec2-a777-beed1712d1a0%2522%257D%255D">40% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of a coast&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110782/">50% live within 3 km of a freshwater source&lt;/a> (only 10% live more than 10 km away from one).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s not just a question of having enough to drink and eat, either. A reliable supply of water is crucial to economic development. Water, as part of the [water-energy nexus](http://the water-energy nexus means that), plays a crucial role in energy production—thermal power plants require large amounts of freshwater to use as a coolant&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and large amounts of water are needed in the production of solar panels and wine turbines. Nearly all industrial activity uses water in some way as a solvent, reactant and/or heat transfer fluid. Even beyond the humanitarian angle of crop failures and drought, a nation that struggles to meet its water needs is a nation doomed to economic stagnation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Climate change will make all these issues worse. While the total amount of precipitation won’t meaningfully change, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16757-w">the distribution of rainfall, snowmelt and river flows will shift&lt;/a>. Weather events will become more heavy-tailed and less predictable. As the soil dries up, it becomes less capable of absorbing water, making the less-frequent-but-more intense periods of rain unable to replenish aquifers. Droughts will increase in frequency and severity. When combined with other issues, such as pollution and eutrophication, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44947-3">potentially billions of people could experience water shortages by the 2050s&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seawater desalination could potentially help alleviate these issues. Historically, it&amp;rsquo;s been an incredibly energy-intensive process, resulting in high costs as well as a high environmental impact, limiting its potential usefulness. But could that be improved? How much better could it get, and would more R&amp;amp;D efforts get us there?&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The largest, most expensive and complex part of a chemical plant is often, not, as is popularly thought, the reactors that combine chemicals to produce new, more valuable ones, but rather the steps that split a mixture of chemicals into distinct streams of a specified purity. The techniques for “de-mixing” are cumulatively known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process">separation processes&lt;/a>. In many respects, this is chemical engineering’s most fundamental discipline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, desalination—the art of separating salt and water—is a relatively simple process. Humans have done it for millennia—Aristotle noted that &amp;ldquo;salt water, when it turns into vapor, becomes sweet and the vapor does not form salt water again when it condenses&amp;rdquo;. But this approach requires enormous amounts of heat, and as such desalination was never feasible on a large scale prior to the Industrial Revolution and the concomitant availability of coal and other fossil fuels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea was revisited at that time, mostly in military contexts. Armies were not as concerned about efficiency and economic viability as they were with the logistical convenience of being able to produce fresh water for their troops &lt;em>in-situ&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Research into economic desalination accelerated after WWII, particularly in the United States. In the 1950s, the southern US underwent a severe drought—the worst in the nation&amp;rsquo;s history—and there was significant political pressure to find a solution. This is when some began to consider the possibility of large-scale, economic distillation of seawater as a source of water security and a bulwark against the fitful caprices of rain. Congress passed the &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-66/pdf/STATUTE-66-Pg328.pdf#page=1">Saline Water Conversion Act in 1952&lt;/a>, which led to the creation of the Office of Saline Water in 1955 and its eventual merging with the Office of Water Resources Research in 1974.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first desalination plants, like the one in Freeport, used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_flash_distillation">multi-stage flash distillation&lt;/a> (MSF) to distill the water. The idea is quite simple: boil the water and collect it, leaving the salt behind. A series of heat exchangers captures the heat from the condensing vapor to boil a subsequent batch of water, minimizing energy waste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/nomac_thermal_msf.jpg" alt="MSF distillation plant">
&lt;figcaption>MSF distillation plants can be identified by the rows of successive tanks placed in series, which are used to recycle heat from vaporization. Pictured here is the Shoaiba desalination plant in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are effective at producing drinkable water, but there was a downside. They are &lt;em>terribly&lt;/em> energy intensive. No matter how you slice it, boiling water takes a lot of energy, and not all of it can be recuperated. A typical MSF plant achieves a Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) of &lt;a href="http://www.iags.org/n0813043.htm">23-27 kWh per m3 of water&lt;/a>. At an electricity price of 20 cents per kWh, that means it would cost $5.00 to produce 1000L of water. But in comparison, the &lt;a href="https://www.akwater.com/story_of_water/html/costs.htm">average price of water in the USA is only $0.40 per 1000L&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach is effective at producing drinkable water in large quantities, but there&amp;rsquo;s a big downside. It is &lt;em>horrifically&lt;/em> energy intensive. No matter how you slice it, boiling water takes a lot of energy, and not all of it can be recuperated. A typical MSF plant achieves a Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) of &lt;a href="http://www.iags.org/n0813043.htm">23-27 kWh per cubic meter of water&lt;/a>. At an electricity price of 8 cents per kWh, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a">roughly the average in the US for industrial customers&lt;/a>, it would cost over $2.00 to produce a cubic meter (1000 L) of water. But in comparison, the &lt;a href="https://www.akwater.com/story_of_water/html/costs.htm">average price of water in the USA is only $0.40 per cubic meter&lt;/a> (although it is strongly location-dependent). And that’s before labor, maintenance, distribution, capital amortization and taxes are factored in, which would, in general, double or triple the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paying over 10x the average price for your water is quite literally a tough sell. In many cases, it’s cheaper to simply ship the water in from elsewhere. It&amp;rsquo;s unsurprising, then, that MSF desalination never saw the widespread adoption that Kennedy and Johnson would have liked. And in the 1970s, funding for desalination dried up—pun unintended&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Desalination was a niche technology of last resort, only used in locations that had access to abundant energy but for whatever reason had no other options for sourcing water.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The ultimate success of desalination can be credited to &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-sci-tech/science-and-environment/in-appreciation-sidney-loeb-desalination-pioneer-dies-at-91">Sidney Loeb&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/smart-water-magazine/dr-srinivasa-sourirajan-father-reverse-osmosis-passed-away">Srinivasa Sourirajan&lt;/a>, who co-invented the &lt;a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3133132">first practical reverse-osmosis membrane&lt;/a>, a much more energy efficient technology. While the concept of a salt-removing filter was not novel, their membrane was the first that was relatively inexpensive, durable, and had a sufficiently high water throughput to be economically viable. The trick was using a two-layer approach: a thin, tightly-woven layer on top provided the salt filtering capability, while a thicker but more porous layer on the bottom provided the strength needed to withstand the required pressures. Today, practically all commercial reverse osmosis membranes still employ the same concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reverse osmosis is achieved by pushing the water across a semi-permeable membrane using a difference in pressure. In a typical setup, the water, once filtered for large debris like branches, rocks, and algae, is fed through a pump and through a spiral-wound tube. The walls of this tube are made of a membrane with tiny pores that allow water molecules to pass through but block larger salt molecules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_membrane.png" alt="Reverse osmosis membrane">
&lt;figcaption>An cutaway of a reverse osmosis membrane. Source: PNNL.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At a first glance, this just seems to be like any other kind of filtering process. What&amp;rsquo;s the big deal? I use a &amp;ldquo;semi-permeable membrane&amp;rdquo; to separate the coffee grounds from my morning brew every day. Why does this have a fancy name attached to it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key distinction between reverse osmosis and a filtering system is the &lt;em>spontaneity&lt;/em> of the process. A fluid filled with undesirable particles will naturally flow through a sieve in the absence of a minimal driving force. Increasing the pressure will increase the flow rate through the filter, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a requirement. Using my coffee as an example, if I was fine with waiting forever, eventually &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of the coffee would trickle down through the filter—except a small amount retained due to surface tension—resulting in almost no energy expenditure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> spontaneous. If you passively place a concentrated salt solution next to a reverse osmosis membrane without applying a driving force, nothing will happen. The water will &lt;em>never&lt;/em> migrate across the membrane on its own. To do so, it needs to fight against the &lt;a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map%3A_General_Chemistry_(Petrucci_et_al.)/13%3A_Solutions_and_their_Physical_Properties/13.07%3A_Osmotic_Pressure">osmotic pressure&lt;/a> generated by the difference in salt concentration across the membrane—hence the term “reverse osmosis”. The amount of pressure needed depends on the membrane permeability as well as the concentration of salt in the seawater.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many advantages to a pressure-driven process over a temperature-driven one. Pressure is a lot less leaky than temperature, leading to better energy efficiencies, and corrosion is much more manageable at lower temperatures. Phase changes (boiling or condensing) require large amounts of energy to be transferred to and from the water, requiring the use of a myriad of heat exchangers, boilers and utility lines, all plumbed together in a complex manner to achieve acceptable efficiencies. Pressurizing a liquid is very easy: just pump it. Not only are reverse osmosis plants more energy-efficient, they are more capital-efficient as well as they are simpler to design and build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pressure requirements are where the bulk of the energy consumption for desalination come from. But how much of that is actually needed? Using advanced physics and material science, would it be possible to invent some kind of magical filter that would let water pass through really easily, but keep the salt out, or to invent some new technique that would be able to sidestep the need for high pressure? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that allow us to have cheap and easy freshwater anywhere in the world, and thus eliminate the threat of thirst for humankind once and for all?&lt;/p>

&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So how much energy is &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> needed to separate a mixture&amp;rsquo;s components from one another? What is, so to speak, the theoretical minimum, and why does it exist?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s start by defining what we mean by &amp;ldquo;mixture&amp;rdquo;. We are referring to a fluid consisting of multiple components (e.g. water, salt, sugar, ethanol) but which has homogenous physical properties throughout the fluid. By contrast, a fluid with heterogeneous physical properties (e.g. water with sand and sticks in it) is called a suspension. This is an informal definition—a more rigorous one would have to address some additional subtleties&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>—but it is good enough for our purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s imagine we have a very large U-shaped tube with a semi-permeable membrane separating two compartments, with freshwater on one side and seawater on the other. Initially, the water is at the same level on both sides. The difference in osmotic pressure draws the water from the freshwater side to dilute the salt. This is a common high school experiment, but it often overlooks an important observation: a simple difference in solute concentration between two solutions can result in &lt;strong>the bulk movement of a weight&lt;/strong>—in other words, performing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)">work&lt;/a>! If there was a ship in the seawater compartment, we could thus exploit the concentration difference to lift the ship up against the force of gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/osmosis.png" alt="Osmosis work">
&lt;figcaption>Illustration of how osmosis can lead to useful (although probably not practical) work.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where does this energy come from? Unfortunately, the complete answer—involving the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_potential">chemical potential&lt;/a>—is somewhat abstract&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, but the gist is that there is potential energy &lt;em>inherent in a difference in concentration&lt;/em>, much like how a difference in height or a difference in temperature can be be exploited to produce usable energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It follows that since reducing a concentration difference can produce energy, &lt;em>returning&lt;/em> to the initial concentrations (via e.g. some purification process) must, at a minimum, &lt;em>require&lt;/em> the same amount of energy. How much energy? The exact amount is known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_of_mixing#Gibbs_free_energy_of_mixing">Gibbs free energy of mixing&lt;/a> (or separation, when considering the opposite process).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, let&amp;rsquo;s examine a hypothetical water desalination system, without any reference to a specific technology or approach. At a high level, any such system would have to look like the block diagram below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_block.png" alt="Desalination block diagram">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the goal is to extract the water from the incoming stream, we can&amp;rsquo;t extract &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of the water, or there would be nothing to carry the salt out of the system. Therefore we have one stream—the seawater—going into the unit and two streams exiting it: a stream of desalinated water called the permeate, and a stream of concentrated saltwater called the concentrate, or brine. The ratio of the flow rate of the fresh water stream to the inlet stream is called the &lt;em>recovery ratio,&lt;/em> and it is the fraction of seawater intake that is converted into freshwater.
$$
R_w = \frac{\text{freshwater flow rate}}{\text{feed flow rate}}
$$
The recovery ratio roughly captures an important tradeoff between capital expenditures and operating expenditures. A higher recovery rate means a smaller feed flow rate is needed to achieve a given freshwater production rate, resulting in smaller pipes and equipment, but also means more energy consumption, as we will see shortly. Desalination plants commonly use a recovery ratio of 50%, but the exact value at a specific facility depends on the particularities of its operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A high recovery ratio results in a more concentrated brine. Intuitively, this should result in more energy required to extract the water since a more concentrated brine will have a higher osmotic pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we convert the Gibbs free energy of separation to a per-unit-volume-of-water basis, we obtain what’s known as the Specific Energy Consumption (SEC):
$$
SEC = \frac{\Delta G_{sep}}{\text{Volume of water produced}}
$$
It turns out that for seawater, due to the fundamental thermodynamic and physical principles, the SEC &lt;em>only&lt;/em> depends on the recovery ratio&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a typical seawater salt concentration of 35 g/L, and assuming a recovery ratio of 50%, we get a SEC of ~1.1 kWh/m3 of water. No matter the separation technique, it is &lt;em>thermodynamically&lt;/em> &lt;em>impossible&lt;/em> to desalinate seawater using less energy&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>As the water gets transferred across the membrane, the brine side becomes more concentrated with salt, which leads to a corresponding increase in the osmotic pressure. This leads to a sharp increase in the SEC above a recovery ratio of ~0.8.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an illustrative example, think of wringing a wet towel: when the towel is soaked, a gentle twist is enough to have the water come gushing out. As the towel is dries out, however, it becomes progressively harder and harder to extract more water out of it, requiring more and more force to be applied until eventually no more will come out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, imagine if you could only apply one level of torque to wring the towel, instead of gradually ramping up the torque. (Perhaps you are programming a robot to do it, and the actuators only have an on/off setting.) In that case, you would have to apply a force that would get the towel to the level of “dryness” that you want to achieve, even if this amount of force is initially overkill when the towel is very wet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same reasoning applies to RO membranes. To achieve perfect efficiency we would need to continuously increase the pressure &lt;em>along the membrane flow path&lt;/em> proportionately to the increase in salt concentration. This is, to say the least, an impractical proposition. The best we could do would be to maintain the pressure &lt;em>constant&lt;/em> over the length of the membrane. In order to achieve a desired recovery ratio, the pressure applied to the membrane needs to be at least equal to the &lt;em>final&lt;/em> osmotic pressure of the brine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_membrane_cross_section.jpg" alt="RO cutout">
&lt;figcaption>As the seawater flows through the membrane, it becomes more and more concentrated in salt as some of the water flows across the membrane, which makes it progressively harder to extract more water out of it.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotting the pressure vs. water recovery on a graph, we get a relative sense of the “wasted” energy vs. the “required” energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_wasted_energy.png" alt="Wasted energy from RO">
&lt;figcaption>Energy efficiency at a recovery ratio of 75%. The blue line is the equilibrium, or &amp;#39;ideal&amp;#39; pressure required (normalized to 1.0 at 0% recovery). The area under this curve (in orange) represents the minimum separation energy. The yellow area under the line represents the &amp;#39;wasted&amp;#39; energy consumption of an ideal single-stage process at constant pressure.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This relationship is, in a sense, the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html">rocket equation&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; of desalination, because there&amp;rsquo;s very few ways to actually improve it. The equilibrium curve is a fundamental property of the fluid, and so there&amp;rsquo;s no technological solution that can change it. There&amp;rsquo;s only two things we can do: change the target recovery ratio, or, just like with rockets, add staging by changing the number of &amp;ldquo;steps&amp;rdquo; we take to reach the final recovery fraction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_wasted_energy_staged.png" alt="Wasted energy from multistage RO">
&lt;figcaption>3-stage desalination, with each stage progressively stepping up the pressure and accounting for 25% recovery. This approach is more energy efficient because more pressure is only applied “when it is needed”. &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of having a single large reverse osmosis unit, we can place multiple smaller units in series, with pumps in between each unit to boost the pressure to the new equilibrium pressure. However, this increases design complexity and capital and maintenance costs, so there’s no free lunch: at some point the additional expenses will exceed any savings from efficiency gains.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The energy intensity of desalination has been one of the primary reasons why it hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen more widespread adoption. (Other issues such as the environmental consequences of brine discharge also dampen the prospects for widespread deployment but are not quite as salient.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning to Loeb and Sourirajan, their invention kicked off a flurry of innovation and continued improvements that persisted for decades. Modern membranes have since come a very long way, with &lt;a href="https://albertsk.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/science-2011-elimelech-712-71.pdf">an almost 90% reduction in energy consumption since the first commercial versions&lt;/a>. Today, reverse osmosis membrane technology has virtually completely displaced MSF and become the standard for desalination plants around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Putting the prior numbers into context, membranes today can now consistently achieve a thermodynamic efficiency of 80-90%, which means they only require about 25% more energy than what’s physically possible. A single-stage RO process with 50% recovery requires ~1.6 kWh/m3 of energy in theory, and the best single-stage commercial RO systems available today use about 2 kWh/m3. The total energy consumption is now consistently less than 5 kWh/m3 and is approaching 3 kWh/m3 for the most efficient plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What does that number actually mean? As an illustrative example, Canada consumed about &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3810027101">4.86 billion cubic meters of potable water in 2019&lt;/a>. If all of that water came from desalination, it would represent an additional 9.7 TWh of electricity per year. Canada&amp;rsquo;s annual electricity production is &lt;a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-canada.html">about 632 TWh&lt;/a>, so desalination would roughly represent 1.5% of total energy consumption. By comparison, if MSF desalination was used instead, it would require over 120 TWh to supply all of Canada&amp;rsquo;s water, or nearly 20% of all energy consumption just to produce water! Keep in mind that Canada is one of the &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use">most energy intensive countries per capita&lt;/a> as well as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most developed economies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, the reverse osmosis step is but one of several needed to obtain drinkable water, but it is the most energy-intensive by far. And modern, large-scale, state-of-the-art facilities are &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> efficient. The Sorek 1 plant in Israel, which opened in 2013, consumes about &lt;a href="https://www.eib.org/attachments/registers/129182965.pdf">740 GWh annually&lt;/a> and has a &lt;a href="https://www.ide-tech.com/en/our-projects/sorek-desalination-plant/?data=item_1">capacity of 640,000 m3/day&lt;/a>, enough water for 1.5 million people. This corresponds to a total energy consumption of 3.3 kWh/m3. So on top of the ~2.0 kWh/m3 needed for reverse osmosis, they only need an additional 1.3 kWh/m3 for pre-filtration, post-treatment, intake, discharge, pressure losses, and the works. It is, frankly, &lt;em>a miracle&lt;/em> that we’re able to get it this low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These high-efficiency systems are unsurprisingly much more complex than the simple diagrams previously shown, with parallelized pipelines, circulation loops, heat exchangers, cleaning systems, and energy recovery devices. A typical piping and instrumentation diagram for a reverse osmosis system will look like a dense and inscrutable maze of symbols and lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One common technique to improve the energy efficiency is to reuse as much of the pressure energy from the brine as possible, since it exits at a high pressure but no longer has any need to be pressurized. &lt;a href="https://energyrecovery.com/water/px-pressure-exchanger/">Pressure exchangers&lt;/a> are nifty devices that can do this with very high efficiency.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>All of this is only a fraction of the plant&amp;rsquo;s functionality! Depending on the quality of the membrane and permeate, sometimes an additional pass is needed, called &lt;a href="https://www.membranechemicals.com/water-treatment/brackish-water-reverse-osmosis/">Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis&lt;/a> (BWRO). In addition, the plant requires systems for pre-filtering the water and handling all the sludge that gets separated out, a post-treatment system that adds minerals, disinfects and adjusts the pH, anti-scaling systems that flush out mineral deposits from the RO membranes to prevent fouling, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, about 1% of the world&amp;rsquo;s drinking water is provided through desalination. This is likely going to rise as water security issues become more pressing, particularly in the Middle-East. The amount of desalination plants being built is rising, thanks to the dropping costs, and has now reached over 100,000,000 cubic meters &lt;em>per day&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tender for the Sorek 2 plant, which will be even larger and more cost-effective than Sorek 1, is &lt;a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/desalination_260520">priced at $0.45/m3&lt;/a>. This is a very, very impressively low number. It’s low enough to affordable to all but the most impoverished households for their daily needs, year-round. This is the &lt;em>miracle&lt;/em> of desalination.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Despite this astonishing progress, at the same time, there’s little evidence of an &amp;ldquo;exponential&amp;rdquo; adoption curve—if anything, growth is slowing down slightly, as the lowest-hanging fruits get picked. Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/ro_capacity.png">

&lt;/figure>
There's a common misconception that droughts are acute, short periods of no rainfall. While this can be the case, in reality they are often prolonged periods of _reduced_ rainfall that can last years. And while a plant can be built, commissioned, and run profitably for a few years over the duration of a long drought, these plants are typically planned and designed to operate over timescales of 20+ years. And just like what happened with Freeport, this makes the economic projections of these ventures fraught with uncertainty. Desalination is a long-term solution, and thus the political and economic incentives also need to be long-term ones.
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$0.45/m3 is very cheap, but it’s still significantly more expensive than what’s typically paid by agriculture, which is by far the largest consumer of freshwater. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2005835117">a recent Berkeley study&lt;/a> estimated the median value of irrigation water for wheat to be $0.05 per m3. In many cases, farmers don’t even pay the costs for distribution or delivery!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s put this into perspective. Growing wheat requires approximately an acre-foot of water per acre of wheat. &lt;a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ers.usda.gov%2Fwebdocs%2FDataFiles%2F47913%2FWheatCostReturn.xlsx%3Fv%3D3339.5">Data from the USDA&lt;/a> indicates that an acre yields on average 45 bushels of wheat and that the total selling price is approximately $350. If the water was purchased from Sorek 2, then it would cost at least $550 per acre to water the crops, more than doubling the minimum production cost of wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To truly usher in an era of abundance and unlock affordable water and water-based economic activities for everyone, we need to eventually reduce desalination costs even further, ideally by 75% or more. Can it be done?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Electricity costs account for &lt;a href="https://www.advisian.com/en/global-perspectives/the-cost-of-desalination">a majority of the operating costs&lt;/a> of a typical desalination facility. But the thermodynamic limit places a fundamental restriction on future cost savings. Desalination is just not at a &lt;em>local&lt;/em> maximum, it’s approaching the &lt;em>global&lt;/em> maximum: energy consumption can only improve by 25% with a &lt;em>physically perfect&lt;/em> separation technology. This is &lt;em>the wall&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/opex_compared.jpg">
&lt;figcaption> Electricity is a large contributor to desalination costs, but is far from the only one. Source: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230521135336/https://www.advisian.com/en/global-perspectives/the-cost-of-desalination">Advisian (now Worley Consulting)&lt;/a>&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Diminishing returns are already starting to kick in: new R&amp;amp;D initiatives are met with disappointing results while membrane performance stagnates. As &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ee/d0ee00341g">this sobering 2020 review notes&lt;/a>, research efforts have been stunted by a &amp;ldquo;universal insignificance of novel materials in further enhancing the energy efficiency of desalination&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other cost drivers are much smaller. Reducing costs elsewhere will be a multifaceted, arduous, and mostly incremental effort—for instance, &lt;em>completely eliminating&lt;/em> &lt;em>maintenance&lt;/em> would only result in a 7% overall reduction in OPEX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, despite a historical learning rate of 12% that’s led to dramatic cost reductions, &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019WR025841">desalination learning rates have sputtered out to near-zero in the past decade&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>…a trend break observed over the last 10 years mirrors an exhaustion of the potential for technical improvements, as well as an increasing complexity and nonlinearity of the factors influencing the [desalination] systems' cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/desalination/learning.jpg">
&lt;figcaption> Recent RO desalination deployments have stagnated in cost, as shown by the grey/black dots. Source: &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019WR025841">Mayor, 2020&lt;/a>&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Recent price reductions have predominantly come from economies of scale: building larger and larger facilities which can take advantage of scaling laws and shared infrastructure. The scale of the aforementioned Sorek 2 plant, for example, is staggering: &lt;a href="https://ide-tech.com/en/project/sorek-b-desalination-plant/">672,000 cubic meters of tap water per day&lt;/a>. That’s a torrent large enough to fill a standard 20-foot shipping container every 5 seconds, nonstop, every single minute of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this, too, has its limits. With larger scales comes larger capital requirements, making project finance more difficult, especially for countries with limited access to credit. The other issue is one of logistics: for its weight, water isn’t very valuable, meaning that distribution costs are a significant portion of the final price paid by the consumer. This works against excessive centralization of freshwater production: when demand from nearby population centers is met and the water must be piped further away, the additional distribution costs will eventually exceed the cost savings from the larger production scales. For this reason, water treatment infrastructure &lt;a href="https://alchemyatscale.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-scale-for-chemical">has a large degree of decentralization&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When all of this is taken into account, this means that desalination has reached its endgame. While there are still small improvements to be made here and there, there&amp;rsquo;s no silver bullet to making it dramatically cheaper, and likely no path to ever reducing costs to make it viable for large-scale agriculture of thirsty crops. The dreams of making deserts bloom remain just that—literal pipe dreams.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#where-do-we-go-from-here">

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>All this isn’t a reason to doom and gloom. Just because desalination isn&amp;rsquo;t becoming more energy efficient doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it can&amp;rsquo;t become more &lt;em>economic&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of focusing on the process itself, we can look for ways to reduce the cost of the inputs: either the cost of electricity or the capital costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, with an average levelized cost of electricity from solar at &lt;a href="https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2023/utility-scale_pv">3 cents per kWh in the US&lt;/a>, and projected to drop even more in the coming years, there’s a case to be made that &lt;a href="https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/smart-water-magazine/towards-solar-powered-desalination-a-path-research-and-challenges">desalination facilities coupled with solar power&lt;/a> could be a cost-effective way of using excess power output. The product, water, doesn&amp;rsquo;t spoil and is relatively easy to store and transport. In fact, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261921002725">proposals to do just that at the US-Mexico border&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Membranes that are more resistant to scaling and fouling, or are more resilient chemical treatment would also drive costs down—the pretreatment and cleaning systems can account for over &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@desalter/the-true-cost-of-drinking-water-understanding-the-expenses-of-reverse-osmosis-plants-4254b4f3f166">30% of a desalination plant’s capital costs&lt;/a> while membrane replacement and treatment chemicals account for about 25% of the operating costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps most importantly, even unfruitful membrane research isn’t for naught. The findings and techniques of desalination will continue to spill over into adjacent disciplines, such as wastewater treatment, mineral recovery systems, and nanomaterials&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In many ways, desalination is one of the most striking case studies of the &lt;a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/eeseniordesignhandbook/2013/engineering-method/">engineer’s method&lt;/a>: displaying its greatest strengths, but also its biggest limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it&amp;rsquo;s a strong testament to the power of first principles reasoning and a scientifically-minded analysis. Starting from a simple thermodynamic thought experiment, something so abstract and naively simplistic that we would think it only good for ivory-tower theoreticians, we can infer a whole bunch of the design tradeoffs and limitations of desalination plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, it demonstrates how engineering can be used to improve the human condition. Stable access to water is a fundamental building block of  civilization. It is necessary for life itself and feeds crops and carries away diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. It is the difference between an uninhabitable wasteland and a hotbed of human activity. Millions of people rely on desalination to ensure that they have enough water to drink, cook, clean, bathe, grow crops, and run their businesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, it shows how continuous, compounding iterative improvement can lead to astonishing advances over long periods. In the history of desalination research, there have been very few specific points that could be considered &amp;ldquo;breakthroughs&amp;rdquo;. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s been a dogged, persistent, multi-decadal effort by many scientists and engineers to bring the cost down to the point where—under specific circumstances—desalination is now a viable, cost-effective solution to water supply issues rather than a niche, uneconomic venture wholly reliant on government subsidies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But on the other side of the coin, the same scientific principles that have led to these tremendous improvements also show that they’re likely not going to keep up. Better designs and better technology will help—to a point. But desalination will never become the technological silver bullet some might hope for. Instead, it will remain a tool in the arsenal of policymakers and governments around the world—a very useful tool, to be sure, but one with specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, desalination’s fate has been intertwined with politics and economics. In the 1950s and 60s, research was reliably championed by Senator—and eventually President—Lyndon Johnson, who had grown up in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Hill_Country">Texas Hill Country&lt;/a> and had lived through the punishing consequences of drought firsthand. But despite this, many plants in the 1970s and 1980s were shut down, unable to justify their costs. And in 1982, the Reagan administration &lt;a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1984/0736/report.pdf#page=15">shuttered the Office of Water Resources Research&lt;/a>, as part of his agenda to defund most (non-military) government science programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When confronted with a large, complex, and multifaceted problem without straightforward solutions, politicians have a tendency to punt the issue to &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo;. Eventually, someone will invent a better technology with no downsides and then we can just use it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that playbook won&amp;rsquo;t work here. There is no big fix coming. The technology we have is what we can and &lt;em>must&lt;/em> make do with. Even Israel, the poster child of what large-scale desalination can achieve, doesn’t depend on it for the majority of its water. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Let-There-Be-Water-Water-Starved/dp/1250115566">Its success with achieving water self-sufficiency can be ascribed to a sophisticated, multi-faceted approach to water conservation&lt;/a>, in which desalination plays only one part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This achievement was built up over decades of trial and error, with a patient, even-handed, long-term strategy that was able to survive the ebbs and flows of electoral politics. The small wins compounded over time into stunning results, but without the spectacle of glamourous ribbon-cutting events and glitzy big expenditures, and without the psychological certainty of salvation that a big gleaming steel plant might bring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solutions to water insecurity exist. Desalination can poke at the boundaries and make them more tractable. But ultimately, it will require courage, political will, and constituents who won’t punish politicians who are willing to take &lt;a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/gambling-on-development/">a gamble on a long-term vision of economic and social development.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The engineering method won&amp;rsquo;t solve this for us. And it never will.&lt;/p>

One of the things that came up during my research was something called the &amp;lsquo;Kantrowitz limit&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the Kantrowitz limit? I admittedly had never heard of it before, but it seemed like something very important that fortunately had technological solutions. Yet there was something unsatisfying about all the popular resources I could find about it. They all seemed to be very surface level, and when I started looking into it the rabbit hole ended up going a lot deeper than I expected, so I am writing this in the hopes that it might be useful to someone else one day.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Kantrowitz limit is a theoretical compressible gas dynamics restriction that places a limit on the flow velocity. It was first derived in 1945 by Arthur Kantrowitz, a physicist and aerospace engineer, from whom it received its namesake, but remained relatively obscure—&lt;a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/modern-compressible-flow-historical-perspective-anderson/M9781260471441.html">&lt;em>Modern Compressible Flow&lt;/em> by John D. Anderson&lt;/a>, the quintessential textbook for gas dynamics, for example, has no mention of it—until 2013, when it was reintroduced into the mainstream engineering lexicon when Elon Musk proposed his Hyperloop concept for futuristic, high-speed travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Musk is a little vague about the Kantrowitz limit in his &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_images/hyperloop-alpha.pdf">Hyperloop white paper&lt;/a>, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really explain any of the technical details, except that it&amp;rsquo;s an important consideration when designing the Hyperlood pods. As he explains:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Whenever you have a capsule or pod (I am using the words interchangeably) moving at high speed through a tube containing air, there is a minimum tube to pod area ratio below which you will choke the flow. What this means is that if the walls of the tube and the capsule are too close together, the capsule will behave like a syringe and eventually be forced to push the entire column of air in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While this is possibly useful to laymen, it is a phenomenological explanation: it describes &lt;em>what&lt;/em> is happening, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on &lt;em>why&lt;/em>. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantrowitz_limit">Wikipedia article&lt;/a> has a fairly succinct explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If a near supersonic flow experiences an area contraction, the velocity of the flow will increase until it reaches the local speed of sound, and the flow will be choked. This is the principle behind the Kantrowitz limit: it is the maximum amount of contraction a flow can experience before the flow chokes, and the flow speed can no longer be increased above this limit, independent of changes in upstream or downstream pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Seems simple enough. The Kantrowitz limit is related to the gas dynamics at near-sonic flow velocities. For vehicles moving at near-supersonic speeds through a tunnel (i.e. Hyperloop pods), the Kantrowitz limit places a design constraint on the ratio of the diameter of the pod to the diameter of the tube.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>All of this is sensible and seems well and good&amp;hellip; except that this is a &lt;em>really, really basic concept that is known by anyone who has studied gas dynamics or aerodynamics at all&lt;/em>. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to be an elitist here: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choked_flow">choked flow&lt;/a> is probably taught by the second or third week of any undergraduate level gas dynamics course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So clearly, there should be more to it than this if someone got their name attached to it! Maybe the Wikipedia explanation was incomplete? What do other online sources on it say? There&amp;rsquo;s a surprising dearth of information—most of the articles I found only give a high level explanation of the Hyperloop. Those that &lt;em>do&lt;/em> dive into the relevant physics, despite otherwise widely ranging in credibility, all seem to just repeat what was said in the Hyperloop whitepaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://mappingignorance.org/2018/02/07/the-limits-of-hyperloop/">This article&lt;/a> by Mapping Ignorance repeats the &amp;ldquo;syringe effect&amp;rdquo;, and also cites an equation that seems to have been taken from the Wikipedia article&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/13/here-is-how-hyperloop-will-work-theoretically.html">CNBC&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mention the concept and just explains that compressor fan will &amp;ldquo;transfer high air pressure from [the pod&amp;rsquo;s] front to the rear and sides&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brilliant.org has a section on the &lt;a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/hyperloop/#physics-of-the-hyperloop">Physics of Hyperloop&lt;/a> where they also repeat the same claims about the Kantrowitz limit and the syringe effect. They directly quote the white paper on this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-key-innovation-that-makes-the-hyperloop-work-1113028439">An article&lt;/a> by Jalopnik specifically about the Kantrowitz limit just uncritically rephrases what Musk wrote, but it does cite &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130217232130/http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-AVT-185///EN-AVT-185-09.pdf">a paper&lt;/a> on the topic! But this paper assumes that you already know what the limit is, so some more digging is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also found &lt;a href="https://www.hyperloopdesign.net/airflow">this&lt;/a> from a site called HyperloopDesign.net which claims that there is no Kantrowitz limit for Hyperloop pods. However, their explanation of the relevant physics seems very dubious&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to consider their argument further.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="so-what-is-the-kantrowitz-limit-really" >So what is the Kantrowitz limit, really?

&lt;a href="#so-what-is-the-kantrowitz-limit-really">

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Without a satisfactory explanation, I decided to read the &lt;a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b184216.pdf">original 1945 paper&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> by Kantrowitz and Donaldson. They were studying the design of diffusers for supersonic air streams (i.e. air intakes for supersonic planes). In short, the Kantrowitz limit has to do with the stability of normal shocks in variable-area ducts when decelerating gases from supersonic to subsonic velocities.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s do a brief aside and discuss the concept of choked flow, since it is rather critical to understanding the issue at hand. You can skip this section if you are already familiar with the relevant physics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a gas flowing through a variable-area duct&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. As the area of the duct shrinks, the gas must either speed up or compress (become denser) to maintain the same mass flow rate. The maximum speed that the gas can reach through a reduction in area is the speed of sound. Once this speed is reached, any further reduction in area cannot increase the speed further (and in fact the gas will always reach Mach 1 at the vena contracta, or point with the smallest cross-sectional area, as long as this area is below the critical area).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/subsonic_choke_no_accel.png" alt="Example of choked flow">
&lt;figcaption>Flow through a converging duct, right at the point where the flow chokes (throat velocity has reached Mach 1).&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, any further reduction of the pressure downstream of the duct will not influence the flow rate; it is considered choked. However, increasing the pressure upstream &lt;em>will&lt;/em> increase the mass flow rate by increasing the density of the gas, but the volumetric flow rate will remain roughly the same. So there is a &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo; amount of shrinkage the duct area can undergo before the flow reaches Mach 1. This, of course, depends on how much the gas decides to speed up vs. compress when the area is reduced, and the &amp;ldquo;speed-up-to-densification&amp;rdquo; ratio depends on the assumptions you make of the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most commonly, we assume that the gas is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_gas">calorically perfect&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and that the compression process is isentropic. In this case, the relationship between the choking contraction ratio and the airspeed is known as the &lt;em>area-Mach number relation&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{1}{\text{Contraction ratio}} = \frac{A^*}{A} = M\left[\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)\right]^{-\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where $M$ is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number">Mach number&lt;/a> at some point in the duct (usually the entrance), $A$ is the area at the point in the duct where $M$ was taken, $A^*$ is the cross-sectional area at the minimum area of the duct (known as the &lt;em>throat&lt;/em>), and $\gamma$ is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity_ratio">heat capacity ratio&lt;/a>, which varies depending on the gas but for air is roughly equal to 1.4. The interesting thing about this equation is how the contraction ratio only depends on the Mach number; there are no variables for temperature, pressure, density, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/compression_ratio_to_mach_annot.png" alt="Area-Mach number relation">
&lt;figcaption>The area-Mach number relation creates a &amp;#39;U&amp;#39; shaped curve. Inside the U, the flow will be choked, and outside, the flow will be unchoked.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something worth noting is that there are actually two solutions of $M$ for a given contraction ratio: one for $M&amp;lt;1.0$ and one for $M&amp;gt;1.0$. This means for any given ratio, there is a subsonic speed below which the flow will not choke and a supersonic speed above which the flow will not choke, surprisingly enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/subsonic-acceleration.png" alt="Accelerating subsonic flow">
&lt;figcaption>Subsonic flow is accelerated in a converging nozzle and chokes at the throat. If the duct diverges after, the flow can accelerate to supersonic speeds.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
This is also the principle behind rocket engine nozzles: a convergent-divergent nozzle will accelerate a gas from subsonic to supersonic velocities as long as the pressure drop is sufficiently high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-with-supersonic-deceleration" >The problem with supersonic deceleration
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-problem-with-supersonic-deceleration">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Since this process is isentropic and therefore reversible, one would imagine that the opposite scenario should also be possible: a converging-diverging inlet that decelerates supersonic gas to subsonic velocities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/supersonic-deceleration.png" alt="Decelerating supersonic flow">
&lt;figcaption>Smooth deceleration of a supersonic stream. In practice, this is not achievable.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, however, this kind of arrangement is not possible to achieve and maintain. There are two problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is that generally, before reaching a supersonic velocity, the system has to first accelerate through a subsonic regime. And a subsonic flow will &lt;em>also&lt;/em> choke the inlet, but at a much lower mass flow rate. As the system speeds up in the subsonic regime, some of the gas must get diverted away from the inlet as it cannot &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; through the throat. The ratio of air diverted away to air entering the inlet is called the &lt;em>capture ratio&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/subsonic-choked.png" alt="Choked sonic deceleration">
&lt;figcaption>Choked inlet at subsonic speeds. Some of the flow that would otherwise have entered the inlet is deflected away due to the pressure buildup.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the airspeed increases further and turns supersonic, the gas can no longer turn away in time (since it cannot receive information faster than the speed of sound). A bow shock will form in front of the inlet, and the subsonic gas on the other side &lt;em>can&lt;/em> turn away from the inlet, maintaining mass continuity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/sonic-choked-deceleration.png" alt="Choked supersonic deceleration">
&lt;figcaption>Once the system settles at its (supersonic) cruising speed, a bow shock will form in front of the inlet. This leads to massive pressure losses, while the flow inside the duct is subsonic.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second problem is that even if a smooth supersonic deceleration is achieved, it is inherently unstable. Since the outgoing flow is subsonic, information about disturbances downstream (such as pressure fluctuations) would be able to propagate through it, lowering the mass flow rate, if only temporarily. However, since the entering gas is supersonic, information cannot propagate upstream through it, and its mass flow rate will remain unchanged. As Kantrowitz explains, &amp;ldquo;it therefore appears that isentropic deceleration through the speed of sound in channels is unstable and unattainable in practice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/unstable-shock.png" alt="Unstable shock">
&lt;figcaption>As the shock moves backwards, it becomes stronger as the flow at the new location is traveling faster, which leads to an even greater pressure drop, causing a feedback loop until the shock is ejected from the inlet.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="implications-of-shock-waves" >Implications of shock waves
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#implications-of-shock-waves">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Shocks are highly irreversible phenomena and will lead to significant amounts of energy dissipation. The total losses across the shock wave are captured by the drop in stagnation pressure. The stagnation pressure drop across a shock wave is given by the following equation:
$$
\frac{p_{t2}}{p_{t1}} = \left(\frac{\frac{\gamma+1}{2}M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} \left(\frac{1}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}M_1^2 - \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
$$
Where $p_t$ is the total, or stagnation pressure, and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote before and after the shock, respectively. The stagnation pressure, is, in turn, directly proportional to the mass flow rate through the duct, as given by the following equation:
$$
\dot m = \frac{p_t A}{\sqrt{T_t}}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{R}}\left(\frac{\gamma+1}{2}\right)^{-\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}
$$
For a given duct area $A$, the mass flow rate depends on the total pressure and the total temperature. Because a shock is adiabatic, the stagnation temperature does not change across a shock, so $\dot m \propto p_t$ only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/shock_pressure_recovery.png" alt="Pressure recovery">
&lt;figcaption>Pressure recovery of air across a normal shock, depending on supersonic Mach number&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, a shock wave will result in total pressure losses. These losses will reduce the mass flow rate through the inlet by the proportional drop in the pressure. A smaller mass flow rate means a smaller throat area is needed to choke the flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So the Kantrowitz limit basically is just the area-Mach number relation multiplied by the stagnation pressure ratio across a normal shock.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Plotting it out compared the basic isentropic compression case, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the shock will greatly limit the design contraction ratio.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>Comparison of the choking contraction ratio with the Kantrowitz limit and with isentropic flow. The Kantrowitz effect means that the flow chokes much sooner than it otherwise would.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Kantrowitz limit is thus relevant when a supersonic flow needs to be decelerated to subsonic flow, such as is the case in air intake ducts on supersonic planes. It appears repeatedly in the literature mostly in papers dealing with the design of supersonic intake ducts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And perhaps instead of &amp;ldquo;limit&amp;rdquo;, a more appropriate term would be &amp;ldquo;effect&amp;rdquo;, as it&amp;rsquo;s not really a limit at all. It&amp;rsquo;s an aerodynamics phenomenon that results in suboptimal mass flow/pressure recovery, but it&amp;rsquo;s not an outright cap on the performance of a system, like the term &amp;ldquo;limit&amp;rdquo; would imply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my great surprise, it does seem like everyone has gotten this wrong—&lt;em>no one&lt;/em> I found correctly explained this, and usually just parroted the &amp;ldquo;syringe&amp;rdquo; explanation from the Musk paper, despite the original paper by Kantrowitz being readily available online (and rather short: the meat and bones of it is only about 5 pages).&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Kantrowitz &amp;ldquo;effect&amp;rdquo; is undesirable as the pressure losses across the shock lower the mass flow rate through the duct. The total pressure ratio is also known as the &lt;em>pressure recovery&lt;/em>, with a perfect pressure recovery being a value of 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as it isn&amp;rsquo;t a hard limit, there are a few workarounds that can be employed to mitigate its effect. The general goal is to make the shock weaker, which will improve the pressure recovery. The most common way to do this is to move the shock wave into the inlet, &lt;em>behind&lt;/em> the throat. In this position, it is stable, and is much weaker than if it were outside and in front of the inlet. This is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;starting&amp;rdquo; the inlet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="overspeeding" >Overspeeding
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#overspeeding">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The simplest solution is to temporarily overspeed the system above the design Mach number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the shock moves through the converging duct, a positive feedback loop will occur: its upstream Mach number will decrease, which means that the shock will &lt;em>weaken&lt;/em>. This results in the throat experiencing an increased mass flow rate, which will reduce the shock backpressure which draws the shock further into the duct. Thus the shock will continue moving until it has passed through the throat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/stable-shock.png" alt="Stable shock">
&lt;figcaption>In this position, the shock is stable. An increase in backpressure will push the shock back, but as it approaches the throat, it will weaken, improving the pressure recovery and causing a negative feedback loop that prevents it from being dislodged.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the opposite situation is also true. As previously mentioned, if the shock is placed at exactly the throat, and there is a temporary backpressure fluctuation, then that could be enough to knock the shock wave out of the inlet, leading to massive energy losses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/metastable-shock.png" alt="Metastable shock">
&lt;figcaption>The shock is at its weakest in the throat (technically, at M = 1.0, there is no shock). But the slightest disturbance or fluctuation in backpressure can have it knocked off and spat out of the inlet, causing a very sudden and disruptive drop in pressure.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is only a viable option for systems operating at relatively low Mach numbers. Beyond a design value of ~Mach 1.6 the amount of overspeeding needed becomes impractical from an engineering standpoint, and above Mach 1.9 it becomes flat out impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/overspeed.png" alt="Overspeed graph">
&lt;figcaption>The overspeed required to start inlets designed for specific Mach numbers dramatically grows above design Mach numbers of 1.6. The dashed line is y = x, for reference purposes.&lt;/figcaption>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Kantrowitz and Donaldson propose a simple solution: increasing the throat size so that it chokes at a &lt;em>subsonic&lt;/em> mass flow rate equal to the expected mass flow rate during supersonic operation at the design Mach number. This inlet design is also known as a Kantrowitz-Donaldson inlet, and it is &lt;em>self-starting&lt;/em>, because it will naturally settle at the desirable equilibrium point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://liem.ca/img/kantrowitz/kantrowitz-donaldson.png" alt="Kantrowitz-Donaldson inlet">
&lt;figcaption>A Kantrowitz-Donaldson inlet has a wider throat which will automatically swallow the shock as soon as supersonic speeds are reached.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The downside is that the pressure recovery is lower than that of a normally-sized inlet since the inlet isn&amp;rsquo;t designed for the desired mass flow rate. The larger throat means the gas will decelerate less before reaching the shock, resulting in more pressure losses. So the tradeoff is whether you want a self-starting inlet that works at ~85% performance or one that needs to be manually started but works at ~95% performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In a similar vein, another solution is to adjust the size of the throat in real time to move the shock past the throat before closing it back up. This approach results in high pressure recovery (and therefore high performance), at the cost of complexity and additional weight.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The last solution is to use a geometry that will force the airflow to turn, producing a series of oblique shocks instead. These will lead to lower pressure losses than a single normal shock. These changes in angle are called &lt;em>ramps&lt;/em>. This can be done through systems like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake_ramp">intake ramps&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlet_cone">inlet cones&lt;/a>, which are a common sight on supersonic aircraft.

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A lot of these considerations pertain to the design of aircraft, but let&amp;rsquo;s return to the original subject matter. The Kantrowitz limit doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be relevant to Hyperloop systems at all. It necessarily only applies to &lt;em>supersonic&lt;/em> systems. The vast majority of concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve seen still have pods traveling at subsonic velocities, which means you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the formation of a shock wave in front of the vehicle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the flow &lt;em>won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> choke, but the massive loss in stagnation pressure due to the shock is the reason why the choked mass flow rate will be significantly lower than what would otherwise be possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-will-actually-happen" >What will actually happen?

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve described the Kantrowitz effect in a scenario with free-flowing air, such as on aircraft: if the air cannot enter the duct, it simply flows around it. With Hyperloop, the situation is a bit different, since it&amp;rsquo;s in a closed tunnel, and there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere for the air to go except behind the the pod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the classical theory of gas dynamics, I would expect the following to happen as the Hyperloop capsule zips down the tube and reaches the choking velocity for its contraction ratio:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The flow reaches Mach 1 at the narrowest point between the capsule and the tunnel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Static pressure would build up in front of the capsule until the pressure is sufficient for the mass flow rates to equalize.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on the pod geometry, the flow may briefly accelerate past Mach 1 before hitting a shock wave as it encounters the backpressure from the air behind the capsule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The drag will increase due to the increased pressure in front as well as the wave drag from the shock wave.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>So Hyperloop pods will likely experience an increase in drag as they approach the sonic condition in the bypass duct. But the key question is: how much extra drag?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where Musk&amp;rsquo;s analogy of a syringe effect is, in my opinion, very misleading. The reason why the resistance of squeezing a plugged syringe rises so rapidly is because you are compressing the air to several multiples of its original pressure (presumably atmospheric). But in a tube that&amp;rsquo;s presumably hundreds or thousands of miles long, this effect would be a lot less dramatic. Yes, the pressure in front of the pod increases, but this would have the effect of increasing the mass flow through the bypass (recall the mass flow equation), so the system would eventually reach a steady-state equilibrium, so the force wouldn&amp;rsquo;t increase in an unbounded manner. But where does this steady state lie?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this question is very complex and requires the use of simulations to get meaningful answers. My gut feeling, based on drag profiles of transonic aircraft&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, is that the increase in drag would significant, but it would be on the order of 3-4x more as opposed a complete showstopper like 100x&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Since the drag of a a Hyperloop pod in near-vacuum conditions is already very low, it&amp;rsquo;s questionable whether adding a compressor or other onboard system to mitigate the effect is worth it at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, this depends on how big the pod is relative to the tunnel. But I suspect that other practical considerations, such as engineering tolerances and supporting equipment, will place an upper limit on the pod size before the drag from densified air in front becomes the main consideration.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their conclusion is that the drag coefficient does begin to increase significantly after choked flow is reached, but by a factor of ~3 for the speed range that they studied. They also concluded that adding a compressor would consume more energy than beefing up the propulsion system to deal with the increased drag. The difference is 231 kW to power the compressor vs. 31 kW to overcome drag—nearly an order of magnitude difference!&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s true that supersonic pods have explicitly &lt;em>not&lt;/em> been left off the table, even if there are no immediate plans for them. And at supersonic speeds, the &lt;em>actual&lt;/em> Kantrowitz effect would indeed apply. A shock would form in front of the vehicle, but unlike in typical scenarios where it would take place, there is nowhere for the air to go, so once again you would see a pressure buildup between the shock and the pod. Depending on the shape of the vehicle and its relative position in the tunnel the shock could take on different shapes as well. But it&amp;rsquo;s still somewhat questionable whether the use of a compressor is worth it, or whether there are other solutions, like the ones previously mentioned, that are simpler and more performant.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Not much. This could be interpreted as a win for Hyperloop systems, as the analysis, &lt;em>prima facie&lt;/em>, suggests that the aerodynamics are not a big problem. But I think the aerodynamics of the pod are a relatively unimportant part of the challenges with Hyperloop, although this facet has received a disproportionate amount of attention from the media (likely due to Musk&amp;rsquo;s unconventional solution of using a compressor, unlike the other aspects of the concept which have been proposed for a long time already).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But make no mistake, there are many other hurdles—technical, practical, economical and political—that need to be cleared to make Hyperloop a reality. Other people have already covered this to death, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go into more detail here.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Everything we&amp;rsquo;ve seen would suggest that what Musk calls the Kantrowitz limit is really just the area-Mach number relation, and to my knowledge there isn&amp;rsquo;t a special name for it. Kantrowitz certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t think he came up with it, since he just mentions it offhandedly in the appendix of his paper, where he simply calls it the &amp;ldquo;isentropic area-contraction ratio&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why did Musk call it the Kantrowitz limit? To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure&amp;hellip; One could try to argue that the formation of the shock wave behind the choke point is reminiscent of the stable configuration described by Kantrowitz and Donaldson, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear from reading the paper that this isn&amp;rsquo;t really what they were concerned about. And naively applying the Kantrowitz limit equation to subsonic systems will get you into trouble—as this graph shows, it results in an underestimation of the true bypass ratio needed&amp;hellip; but these values are physically meaningless, since you can&amp;rsquo;t have a shock at subsonic velocities!&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But with that said, if there is a distinction to make here, it&amp;rsquo;s a mostly pedantic one. From quickly skimming a few of these papers, I don&amp;rsquo;t think any serious engineers or scientists made this mistake. It seems to be a purely nomenclature thing. Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph from the prior CFD paper on the blockage ratio vs. free-stream Mach number, reproduced side-by-side with just the area-Mach number equations. Their results are correct—they just called it something it ain&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it seems that before 2013, the Kantrowitz limit was a niche phenomenon that applied to supersonic inlet duct design and was used almost exclusively in that context. After Musk published his white paper, everyone has since erroneously ascribed it to the phenomenon of choked flow and it has since been taken up and popularized &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DnmPcJ6OiBg?t=76">by&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HYrO03vqm4Q?t=448">everyone&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/I8sOxSa3j3g?t=56">else&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It&amp;rsquo;s a prime example of &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/978/">citogenesis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Technically, yes. So the title is a little bit of a clickbait. But it has a very specific technical meaning—it refers to the maximum unchoked contraction ratio of a duct that is specifically:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Naively designed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a supersonic stream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unstarted&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that these criteria, with perhaps the exception of the first one, apply to Hyperloop. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the issues described by the limit likely aren&amp;rsquo;t issues at all. I am not up-to-date with the latest developments in Hyperloop technology, but other people seem to be reaching the same conclusions: Virgin Hyperloop pods, for example, don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing very much to mitigate the drag from choked flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>At the very least, it seems that the Wikipedia pages on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantrowitz_limit">Kantrowitz limit&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop">Hyperloop&lt;/a>, at the time of writing, have some glaring inaccuracies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this, of course, needs to come with several caveats. I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent that much time looking into current-gen Hyperloop technologies, and I may have missed other people&amp;rsquo;s solutions to the pod aerodynamics. I&amp;rsquo;m also not an expert on compressible gas dynamics, so there&amp;rsquo;s always the possibility that I am mistaken somewhere. If someone has more information than me about this, please &lt;a href="mailto:liem.daq@gmail.com">get in touch&lt;/a>—I&amp;rsquo;d love to know!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I actually have no idea where this equation comes from. The paper that Wikipedia cites doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it, and from what I can tell it doesn&amp;rsquo;t match up with any of the classical equations I am familiar with. My suspicion is that it was incorrectly transcribed from a derivation of the Kantrowitz limit, since it lines up qualitatively. Hopefully it isn&amp;rsquo;t used for anything serious&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to even make of their claims. The Kantrowitz limit equation &lt;em>is specifically&lt;/em> for compressible fluids. Why would they think that we&amp;rsquo;ve overlooked the fact that gases become compressible at transonic velocities? And what they do mean by supersonic flow &amp;ldquo;compressing&amp;rdquo; the gas along the tunnel? Supersonic flows cannot, by definition, compress anything except through shock waves. That seems like something that would be important to mention. Where did they get all these numbers for the compression ratios?! And this is just the beginning of a long list of issues with this page.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>The theory of aerodynamics and compressible gas dynamics is surprisingly young. The theory of supersonic shock waves was only developed in 1908, and theoretical solutions to fundamental problems such as flow fields over supersonic blunt bodies were still actively being researched until the mid 1960s. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Prandtl">Ludwig Prandtl&lt;/a>, considered to be the father of aerodynamics, died in 1953 and was still actively performing research.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>The flow is usually understood to be due to a difference in pressure, but to be pedantic, it is really a difference in &lt;em>free energy&lt;/em>. Pressure is just potential kinetic energy.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold for Mach numbers &amp;gt; 5.0, but in many cases is actually a fairly reasonable assumption for speeds below that and will generally get you within +/- 10% of the actual answer.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>This is not really an apples-to-apples comparison, since aircraft, as previously mentioned, have free-flowing air around them. Transonic aircraft will experience &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mach_number">localized shock wave formation&lt;/a> which will result in significantly increased drag, which I ballpark to be within the same order of magnitude as in a Hyperloop pod traveling at its choking velocity.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:7" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>There should also be a point where the drag will begin to &lt;em>decrease&lt;/em>, as more of the flow becomes supersonic and the boundary layer experiences less disruption. So it&amp;rsquo;s not like the drag will continue to monotonically increase, either.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:8" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>To be clear, I am only commenting on the phenomenon as opposed to implying any kind of moral culpability on the part of Youtubers. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to expect them to do this much digging to get the proper background on a very niche aerodynamics effect.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
